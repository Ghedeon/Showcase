And I chose <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandra\" target=\"_blank\">Bandra</a></strong> as my home. It was one of those ‘destined’ moves as I like to term it. 🙂</p>\n<p>Bandra grows on you. It slowly becomes the center of your life, and you start believing that there is no other world outside of it; an aberration one slowly and gleefully slips into.</p>\n<p>When people ask me what is it like to live in Bandra, my answer, with a grin, is everyone walks in slippers, takes rickshaws, eats breakfast for dinner at Good Luck Cafe &#8211; an Iranian restaurant &#8211; for 110 rupees, prays at <a href=\"http://www.mountmarybasilicabandra.in/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mount Mary’s</strong></a>, meets at Bandstand, Mehboob Studio is the landmark for everything, and you have Shahrukh, Salman, Rekha, Farhan Akhtar, John Abraham, etc. etc. living down the road. It is towering high rises, charming Koli and East Indian villages, and centuries old churches, juxtaposed next to each other in quaint harmony.</p>\n<p>Bandra’s bent towards juxtaposition can perhaps be surmised as the very core of its reputation as a culturally and artistically ‘open’ minded suburb, which often blatantly, and at other times in subtle undertones, gets expressed. A classic example of the latter being its graffiti decorated walls that have been written much about. Google Bandra + Graffiti, and you will know what I mean. They are works of art in their own right created by National Institute of Design students and aspiring artists.</p>\n<p>But there are works you will not find on Google. As I walked back from St Peter’s Church on Hill Road this morning, powerful unabashed statements on gender issues met my eye. A street vendor selling keys, seeing my excitement, suggested I take the tiny side lane, Nagrana Lane, by the bus stop further down. “There is much more there. You will like it!” I didn&#8217;t just like it. I was smitten. Bandra was turning its magic on me, a bit more.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Graffiti essay: Tackling gender inequality on Hill Road<br />\n</strong></em>Executed by Population First as part of their <a

Sorry, sane people of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p>A judge there ruled that a dude who fucked an unconscious woman in the mouth (i.e., raped her) cannot be prosecuted because &#8220;[f]orcible sodomy cannot occur where a victim is so intoxicated as to be completely unconscious at the time of the sexual act of oral copulation.&#8221; WHAT THE HOLY FUCK OKLAHOMA, THERE IS LITERALLY NO WAY FOR AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON TO CONSENT TO ANYTHING, HOW IS STICKING YOUR DICK IN A PASSED-OUT WOMAN&#8217;S MOUTH NOT AN ACT OF FORCE, I CANNOT STOP YELLING AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE YELLING AT OKLAHOMA RIGHT NOW.</p>\n<p>Dear Oklahoma: there is a time for strict construction of legislation, and there is a time for convicting a fuckwit of forcible sodomy when he mouth rapes an unconscious woman. To everything there is a season, and this is the season of me frothing at the mouth with incoherent rage; surely, there is a way to both prosecute this clear act of sexual assault <em>and</em> fix your loophole-ridden laws. Although maybe I can use this ruling as precedent, and avoid an assault rap by beating this judge with a sock full of nickels while he&#8217;s asleep and unable to protest. I do not normally condone violence, but seriously, Oklahoma, you started it.</p>\n<p>As ever, any fleeing Oklahomans who believe that women are people are welcome in New Jersey (I know I don&#8217;t actually live there any more, but I still feel comfortable extending the invitation).</p>\n",

      "URL": "https://arnabchanda.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/why-aziz-ansari-has-destroyed-my-chances-and-why-he-is-so-so-important/",
      "short_URL": "https://wp.me/p1wQ9Y-7f",
      "content": "<p>Throughout my life, even though we’ve never met, Aziz Ansari has consistently beaten me to the punch. It’s becoming a theme. A sometimes very annoying theme. Although, for various reasons I’ll discuss below, I do believe he has been the most important Indian Comedy Actor in the past 10 years.</p>\n<p>In his new series on Netflix, <em>Master of None</em>, Aziz Ansari says “There can only be two,” referring to the idea that there can only ever be 2 Indians in one show at any point, max. Studio Executives and Networks are afraid to put any more than that, and they’re afraid most of the time, to even put one on.</p>\n<p>I remember when I started doing stand-up in New York City in 2003, and after watching me, a fellow comic asked me “Oh, do you know Aziz Ansari? He’s an young Indian stand up as well.” Aziz was another comedian starting out in NYC at the same time as me. But even then, in 2003… in one of the biggest cities in the world, I got the feeling, “Wow, it’s like there’s only two of us.”</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>\n<p>I love acting. Since I was a kid, it was the only thing I ever wanted to do in my life. I was good at it too. I won theatre awards in Middle School, High School, and University. It was my dream and I was determined to make it happen.</p>\n<p>But, as an Indian guy with a British passport and an American accent due to growing up abroad, it’s been somewhat of an impossible dream living here in London. Not just because of my lack of talent with accents, but with the inherent racism that seems to quietly exist within the entertainment industry here.</p>\n<p>The great myth I had, when I started stand-up, was that doing stand-up would lead to comedy acting. It was the only reason I was determined to compete in U.K. stand-up competitions like the Amused Moose or Jongleurs, and try and win them, which I did. And it was the only reason I continued to grind away on the circuit for 8 years, day in and day out, and do stand-up spots on TV, with the tiny hope that I would get the opportunity to act in something, which would then lead to something else. But I never enjoyed stand-up, and I did it for no other reason than I thought it would potentially guide me back to acting.</p>\n<p>But the reality is, stand-up is not the TV or Film industry. Stand-up is a meritocracy. If you work your ass off, the best comics will, for the most part, rise. You can command audiences to come see you. And these audiences will pay regardless of your race or gender or ethnicity. They just want funny.</p>\n<p>The same is not true in TV or Film. Stand-up was always a means to an end for me. The problem, I discovered, is that the “end”, does not exist.</p>\n<p>In Britain, the below is the essence of every conversation I’ve ever had with a Producer or Agent or Director:</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> We can’t cast you because of your accent.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> Well, we’re looking for someone from London.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> But I live in London. I’ve lived here for over 10 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> I know. But we’re looking for someone English.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> I am English. I’ve lived here for 16 years of my life. I was born here.</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> I know, but English English.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> What’s that mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> Someone with an English accent.</p>\n<p><strong>Me:</strong> Why?</p>\n<p><strong>Them:</strong> Because… uhhh.</p>\n<p><strong>END SCENE.</strong></p>\n<p>This has been my life as an British-Asian-American Accent actor in London for the past 11 years. There-just-aren’t-any-roles.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/135233056\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Arnab Chanda Acting Showreel\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Of the roles on my acting showreel (Found here: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/135233056\">https://vimeo.com/135233056</a>), about 85% of them have come from friends and performers essentially writing parts for me: Dan Clark, Julia Davis, Noel Fielding, etc., all wrote parts specifically with me in mind. Only two roles I’ve ever gotten in 11 years have come from auditioning. One was an ITV2 series called <em>Trinity</em>, in which I played a University student, and the other was a BBC3 pilot called <em>UP!</em>, in which I played, yes, a University student. It is as though the only possible scenarios in Britain to have an American or Asian in a show is if it’s set at university or school. It’s frankly, insane.</p>\n<p>I’m not even talking about Asians either. I’m talking about how parochially BRITISH shows are in Britain. If you were to watch English comedies, you would get the sense that there are absolutely no American or foreign people here at all.</p>\n<p><em>Catastrophe</em>, starring Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, is one of the first comedies I’ve seen in the U.K. that stars an American. <em>The Mighty Boosh</em>, with Rich Fulcher, is the only other one in the past 11 years I’ve seen since living here. 11 years. 2 Americans in comedies. It’s shocking.</p>\n<p>I remember being in a meeting at the BBC about an Australian female comic. They said it was hard to have her be a lead, however, because she was Australian, and British audiences wouldn’t understand how she ended up in London. My heart sank. What in God’s name were they talking about?!? We live in LONDON. A capital of the world. People from all over the world move here and live here. Why would an audience find it odd to have an Australian lead? It’s mind boggling.</p>\n<p>As Aziz states in his brilliant article (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/arts/television/aziz-ansari-on-acting-race-and-hollywood.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0\">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/arts/television/aziz-ansari-on-acting-race-and-hollywood.html?emc=eta1&amp;_r=0</a>), what we see on TV isn’t representative of the diversity we see in life. We don’t live in a closed world anymore. People move around. People have weird accents. People have weird names and looks. And here’s the thing: it’s not that important. In fact, it’s the least interesting thing about that person.</p>\n<p>Kal Penn (from <em>Harold and Kumar</em> fame) has talked extensively about how he had to change and aglicize his name because he wasn’t getting any auditions with his real name, Kalpen Suresh Modi. After he changed it, his job offers escalated by 50% because Casting Directors couldn’t tell he was Indian from his name anymore.</p>\n<p>Arj Barker (from <em>Flight of the Conchords</em>), another one of my favourite comedians of all time, also changed his name from Arjun Singh.</p>\n<p>Why is this necessary? Why does this keep happening?</p>\n<p>It is why I admire Aziz Ansari so much. In 2003, in New York City, you did not want a name like “Aziz Ansari.” It was still post 9/11, and the comedy climate was not good. People were still on edge, and walking on stage with a name like Aziz could not have been easy. I know that walking on stage with a name like Arnab wasn’t easy. People judged. Quick.</p>\n<p>But he never changed his name, and he hustled. He started doing his own shows at UCB, made one of the best sketch shows I’ve ever seen in my life for MTV (Human Giant), and played Tom Haverford in <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. Tom Haverford. He beat a whole bunch of white dudes to land that role. He’s the man.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>\n<p>As much as I support and appreciate the female fight for wage parity in Hollywood, a really awful and selfish part of me always thinks “At least you have a wage battle you can wage! We can’t even audition for any roles!”</p>\n<p>I’m not asking anyone for anything. I’ve learned in this life that you have to hustle and bust your ass to get anything. You have to write your own scripts and make your own things. I’ve also worked in Advertising, TV writing, and as a Producer just to make a living, because I couldn’t make a living doing what I wanted to do. Not everyone in life can do what they want. Life is not fair, and I’m not going to cry about it. And there are obviously much worse off people than me in the world. But, one of the main problems for me, and for other Asian actors, is that we can’t get breaks in our careers, because there are none to be had.</p>\n<p>There’s a problem with the industry, and it has to change. It starts with Commissioners, and it works it’s way down to Producers and Directors and Writers. It’s a group effort, but when you see shows like <em>Master of None</em> or BBC3’s <em>Romesh Ranganathan: Asian Provocateur</em>, you genuinely realize we’re neglecting a lot of interesting voices out there.</p>\n<p>I recently wrote a comedy pilot called &#8220;International Boy&#8221; which was exactly about all the above themes that I&#8217;ve had to deal with in my life. It was a personal script about the complicated times in which we live, and how one can&#8217;t seem to be accepted because they&#8217;re just too many things. Aziz Ansari might have beaten me to the punch again about this, but that&#8217;s ok. Someone needs to get the message out there that things need to change, and he has the smarts and hustle to do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Arnab Chanda is a BBC Radio Comedy Producer, Writer, &amp; Actor.</strong><br />\n<strong>Follow Arnab on Twitter!</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arnabacus\" target=\"_blank\">@arnabacus</a><br />\n<strong>Check out his Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.arnabchanda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.arnabchanda.com </a></p>\n",

I didn&#8217;t even go to the last game. I was a deeply troubled sixteen year-old runaway and drop-out by the time the Whalers said goodbye to Hartford. The Civic Center and the 15,000 or so mourners who packed it to the rafters that day seemed a million miles away to my teenage self. It was a dark time to live in Connecticut and a dark time in my life, and quite frankly I was far too concerned with cultivating my image as a miserably cool punk rock kid to be caught dead wearing kelly green and crying in public.</p>\n<p>In a way it is perfectly fitting that the one thing I remember most vividly is a meaningless old-timer&#8217;s game in the early nineties, a cold day in Hartford on which I had both the chance to meet Gordie Howe, and I pissed my pants in public. I remember that day with equal measures of shame, pride and awe, and it has come to encapsulate everything it means to me to be a Whalers fan.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember becoming a Whalers fan. My grandmother had been an active member of the Booster Club since before I was born, and it was just something I accepted as a fact of life. The sky was blue, the Earth was round, and the Rufini family rooted for the Whalers. I very much took it for granted. The unlikely set of circumstances which led to the Civic Center being built, the Whalers coming to town, surviving the Civic Center roof collapse, and somehow joining the NHL to become our first and only major league franchise were recent history in my childhood, but still history. I had no memories before the Whalers and even as I grew older and uncertainty about their future began to grow, I never really believed they would go. Kevin Dineen was this guy my grandma knew. They practiced at the same dumpy rec rink where my Uncle Jimmy coached the ECHO Stars and Mike Veisor was his buddy. They were completely and thoroughly integrated into our unexceptional suburban Connecticut world.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot of memories of going to games, so it was notable when our entire family &#8211; grandparents and aunts and uncles and cousins and all &#8211; packed into several cars that day and departed for the Mall to see my cousin Jimmy&#8217;s youth hockey team play against the Whaler&#8217;s old-timer squad. My folks were blue-collar through and through, and tickets weren&#8217;t cheap or easy to come by. Corporations bought up all the good seats in blocks and our fans were derided as &#8220;nerds and actuaries&#8221; by our neighbors to the north in Boston. If we went at all, it was one of us at a time with Grandma Rufini.</p>\n<p>On the ride over, somebody, it could have been my dad or my mom but I&#8217;m really not sure, suggested off-handedly that &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll get to meet Gordie Howe today&#8221;. I don&#8217;t remember who said it, but I remember with perfect clarity the revelation that followed:</p>\n<p><em>This is a big deal.<a href=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"96\" data-permalink=\"http://cthockeyviolence.com/2015/10/18/gordie-homey-and-the-time-i-pissed-my-pants-in-public/hccexterior2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg?w=288&#038;h=322\" data-orig-size=\"200,225\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hccexterior2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg?w=288&#038;h=322?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg?w=288&#038;h=322?w=200\" class=\" wp-image-96 alignright\" src=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg?w=288&#038;h=322\" alt=\"hccexterior2\" width=\"288\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg 200w, https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/hccexterior2.jpg?w=133&amp;h=150 133w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>There was a good crowd outside the Civic Center that day, even hours before the game. The atmosphere was akin to a street festival, as strange as that may seem now. I&#8217;ve asked various family members to pin down a month or even a year, but the answers I&#8217;ve received range from &#8220;had to be the eighties&#8221; to &#8221; I have no clue&#8221;. The sole identifying detail I recall from that day is a surreal vision of a man on stilts impersonating Homey D. Clown, the character from <em>In Living Color,</em> which places this game firmly somewhere between 1990-1993. Gordie was over sixty years old at that point, and been retired for about a decade. I imagine that it really was a big deal to see him play a game at that point, even a meaningless one against my cousin&#8217;s stupid youth team.</p>\n<p>We got there early and killed time in the mall, as was standard procedure at the time. My folks let me go off by myself for a bit and I eventually found myself in some now-extinct chain book store, either a Bretanos or Waldenbooks, pacing nervous circles in the magazine section. I was an anxious kid and the offhand mention of possibly meeting Gordie Howe had grown from a flutter in my stomach to full-blown nausea. This was the greatest to ever play the game, the Babe Ruth of Hockey. I paced a circle in the corner of that book store tighter and tighter and faster and faster until I thought to myself &#8220;Oh Shit&#8221; and was certain that whatever it was I&#8217;d eaten for lunch, presumably Wendy&#8217;s, was going to come up. But it didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>I felt a warm wet spot grow in my pants, looked down and saw I was standing in a puddle of piss in the middle of Bretanos/Waldenbooks/whatever it was. I was so nervous about meeting Gordie Howe that I had literally pissed my pants.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/whalestore.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"101\" data-permalink=\"http://cthockeyviolence.com/2015/10/18/gordie-homey-and-the-time-i-pissed-my-pants-in-public/whalestore/\" data-orig-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/whalestore.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"whalestore\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/whalestore.jpg?w=359&#038;h=208\" data-large-file=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/whalestore.jpg?w=480\" class=\" wp-image-101 alignleft\" src=\"https://cthockeyviolence.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/whalestore.jpg?w=359&#038;h=208\" alt=\"whalestore\" width=\"359\" height=\"208\" /></a>The details of what followed are understandably vague. As busy as the mall was that day, that corner of the book store was mercifully empty. I somehow covered myself up and found my father, who bought me a pair of grey sweatpants emblazoned with Pucky the Whale, took me to the bathroom and threw my pissed jeans in the trash. We sat close to the ice, far closer than I&#8217;d ever been, and I watched a sixty-something year-old Gordie Howe absolutely demolish my cousin on the ice of the Hartford Civic Center.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that I had a chance to meet Gordie Howe at some point that day, just as I&#8217;m equally sure I was too scared to go through with it. I&#8217;d be lying if I said I remembered either way. I wore those Pucky sweatpants to school the following week and one of my friends, a Bruins fan, asked me incredulously, &#8220;Dude, you like the Hartford Failers?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Twenty years later, I was living in Hartford working 70 hour weeks in my first head chef job, when a friend invited me and the kids back to the Civic Center for a Sunday matinee. &#8220;The Whale is back,&#8221; they said. &#8220;Sort of.&#8221; The monster-truck rally vibe I got from the marketing of previous minor league team, the Hartford Wolf Pack, had failed to catch my interest in the same way that the Bruins and the Rangers failed to do so. They&#8217;d made so little impact that I wasn&#8217;t even aware that they&#8217;d gone. I liked hockey well enough, but above all, I loved Hartford. The was no replacing that weird underdog team that brought Gordie Howe to my backyard and made me piss my pants. I didn&#8217;t know much about minor-league hockey but I said sure.</p>\n<p>So I watched a hockey game for the first time in many years, now a father with two kids of my own. It was familiar in as many ways as it was different. On that winter day in early 2011, in the span of just a few hours, the Whale had gone from a painful old wound from my childhood to my kids first hockey game. They lost, true to form.</p>\n<p>We exited the arena at the corner of Ann and Church, where my toddler son abruptly pulled down his pants and took a piss right on to the stairs of the coliseum.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; he said sheepishly. &#8220;I just got really excited and had to go.&#8221;</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>An audio version of this post is available <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/chillercold/heels\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Somehow the shoes &#8211; not the clothes &#8211; were what did for me. Two crammed bin liners in, and I abruptly threw the second one down and walked out of the room. (It needs doing. It needs doing.) All the dresses I&#8217;d had made for me by my tailor in the 90s and noughties, those went some time ago. I didn&#8217;t feel much more than a fleeting sadness for them. I&#8217;m older now. I wear different clothes. I couldn&#8217;t get into them anyway. That is the order of things as one gets older. </p>\n<p>But the shoes, those are different. I could get into all of them. But I couldn&#8217;t walk in any of them, not five steps. And what would I wear them to? I don&#8217;t leave the house. </p>\n<p>Dozens of spike heels. These ones I bought for a bash at the Savoy. These, I got in Church&#8217;s at Chancery Lane, their neat black ankle strap always looked so elegant. These ones went perfectly with those brown trousers I had. These were my fuck me heels. They worked. Running shoes. That I ran in, in the cool black evenings, gloves on, headphones on. Here are summer wedges, gingham, high, I made him take them off me with his teeth. These came to New York. These to Frankfurt, there&#8217;s still blood in them. These boots went to Rome and Istanbul. These Mary Janes went to Venice. Paris, Paris, and Paris: these ones. Brussels: the first Eurostar out, always, in the blue grey London dawn, in a rattling black cab over the pink waking Thames, and nobody has breathed the air yet. It is all mine. Those went to Dallas. These went to Chicago. I bought these in Vermont while skiing (skiing!), these in New York, these in &#8230; where the hell did I buy these? Spain? Portugal? </p>\n<p>Grey patent. Red patent. Red glitter. Red velvet. Red suede. Raspberry patent. Dark blue velvet, kitten heels, I climbed a mountain in Thailand in you. Incongruously. Emerald printed cotton. Yellow silk. Purple silk. Silver.</p>\n<p>Here are the black strappy wedge boots I was wearing that night, about a week before I got signed off work. It was autumn. I&#8217;d been falling over a lot for a year, but this one was memorable. I went over for no reason whatsoever in that little lane that leads down to Catford Bridge, and I came down on that massive wooden sleeper thing. Hand, knee. And there was a woman there and I couldn&#8217;t get up and it was the first time I&#8217;d experienced that, the complete marionetting of my body, the cutting of all strings. The lack of connection between intent and action. I couldn&#8217;t move while she asked, down a tunnel, through a blanket, in a foreign language I slowly realised was English &#8220;Are you alright?&#8221; It was only seconds and when my body switched back on again I exploded upright &#8211; &#8220;Fuck!&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Are you alright?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Yes,&#8221; as I stamped off. But I wasn&#8217;t. And suddenly there wasn&#8217;t any wiggle room to pretend I was, any more, in these boots, these pretty boots.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s what happened next, going into the bin liners: the Uggs that I lived in solidly from January &#8217;09 for a year or two. The only things I could stand up in. The only things that didn&#8217;t make me bleed when I walked. After I bought them I never wore any of my lovely shoes again. Not once. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like going through the possessions of someone who has died. There is no bright side to it. Just loss. I am troubled by her ghost. </p>\n<p>I am troubled by my ghost. </p>\n<p>I remember being alive, and it is difficult to reconcile then and now, difficult to reconcile me and this. I struggle with it. I work hard not to.</p>\n<p>So I take a break and write this.&nbsp; It needs doing. The clearing, I mean. You can&#8217;t live with the dead tucked under your bed and in the bottom of your wardrobe. You can&#8217;t live with it and expect to be ok. It needs doing. </p>\n<p>And writing about it needs doing too. I can jam all that stuff into black bags and junk it, but I also need to sit down with that grief and look it in the eye. Not indulge it or invite it to come and live with me. But admit that it&#8217;s there. I feel sad for the things that happened to her, that girl. She was odd, but good. Odd, but loyal. Odd, and all fire. Unstoppable, until she stopped, unbreakable until she broke.&nbsp; Now she is gone, and nothing rushes in to fill the space she left. Nothing. Rushes. In. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. But there is a future. So it must hold something. It won&#8217;t be spike heels, running shoes, ski boots.</p>\n<p>Something else.</p>\n",

It is not love at first sight and there is no Hollywood meet-cute, but there is a touching of souls, as Joni Mitchell once sang, that reverberates long after you meet him.</p>\n<p>Months later, you leave everything you know and traverse continents to go back to him and a new life in the city he has bequeathed you. Over the next three years, you learn that Great Loves can be irrational and painful, full of terrible highs and soaring lows, that passion is overrated, and it is never good, as someone once told you, to love another person more than you love yourself. One day, you wake up and realise that love is not enough.</p>\n<p>Love, in fact, is never enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 28</strong> when you experience death – sudden, tragic, wrenching &#8211; for the first time. On a bright summer’s day in your office in London, you get a call from a policeman who tells you that your oldest sister, who has been missing for months, has been found dead in a car park overlooking the Cornish coast. You drop everything and run out for shelter in a Soho doorway, watching the world continue to turn as yours changes forever.</p>\n<p>Late that night, you make the five-hour drive down to a Cornish hospital with your mother and sister to identify her, in the tiny chapel where they have laid out her body, and receive a crash course in pain, the finality of death, and the meaning of loss. You discover what it’s like to grieve under a terrible litany of <em>shoulda/woulda/couldas</em> and <em>what ifs</em> that spin endlessly into a vortex and threaten to suck you into the darkness.</p>\n<p>For a long time after, you dream that she is with you – at a gathering or a party or at home. She gets up to go, as she always does, and you urge her to stay – over and over again. She never listens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(<strong>You are 14</strong> the first time a boy calls you beautiful. Late one summer night, by the swings in Oakmere Park, where you have gone with a friend for a walk. He whispers into your ear urgently and you smile in a way that suggests you’re used to such things. Inside you know that tomorrow you will put on your ugly school uniform and go back to normal life.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 5 years and six months old</strong> when your parents take you and your sisters from your home in England and deposit you in a Catholic boarding school in a South Indian hill station &#8211; once the summer retreat of the colonial English. You do not realise it then but you will be ensconced there for the next seven years, only flying back home to England for the winter and summer holidays.</p>\n<p>Twice a year for the next seven years, you will dread the long tunnel at the entrance to Heathrow airport, which you will always associate with your mother’s sobs as she tries to say goodbye. When you get to the school in the Indian hill station, you will cry into your pillow quietly for three nights as great waves of homesickness and guilt and regret consume you, until one morning you wake up and the strange boarding school has become your home again.</p>\n<p>You will also cry each time you leave the school to go home for the holidays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 33</strong> – the age your sister was when she died (and Jesus) – an age you secretly thought you would never reach because you thought you had been cursed to die too, like the heroine of some morbid fairytale. You have spent the last five years caring less and less about your life, drinking too much, partying more recklessly, haunting crowded bars and clubs, indulging in careless flings and desperate love affairs, going through the motions in a career you hate more and more.</p>\n<p>On your 33<sup>rd</sup> birthday, you leave the job, end the last relationship, and clear out your cupboards. At some point during this year, you will embark on a new career as a journalist, which you will embrace like it is your calling. For the first time in your life, you are proud of what you do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 12</strong> when your mother takes you out of your boarding school and puts you in a school near your home in England. You don&#8217;t know it then but she has begged the headmaster to let you in, even though he knows nothing about you &#8211; a strange Indian child in his very English school. He puts you in the bottom class of your year, with kids who already know they’re destined for hours of woodworking lessons and dreary home ec classes.</p>\n<p>You realise for the first time that you look different from your classmates, who also seem strange to you in their overwhelming whiteness and brash confidence and determination to break the rules. Being around boys for the first time makes you self-conscious. You get called a Paki on your way home by two awkward boys from the other school in the neighbourhood, on the other side of town. You don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s more embarrassed. The next term, you’re moved up to the top set and a different world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 39,</strong> four months from your 40<sup>th</sup> birthday, when you watch your father take his last racking breath in a quiet hospice bed in a North London suburb. He has been diagnosed with a brain tumour almost exactly two months earlier. You fly back home to England from Cairo when your sister tells you this, steeling yourself for your entry into the darkness once more.</p>\n<p>Unlike your sister’s passing, however, your father’s death offers a chance at redemption. Your relationship with him has long been strained but you visit him twice a day, feed him, sit with him and try somehow to transmit all the love you can muster when you hold his hand. He cannot speak but his eyes follow you around the room as you move and you hope that, somewhere inside, he recognises that he is not alone.</p>\n<p>After he dies, you feel an overwhelming urge to have a child – a primal call, you think, to complete the circle of life. It doesn’t happen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 42</strong> and in a committed relationship for the first time in your life. You, who have always fled commitment and run headlong into the arms of men incapable of giving it to you, are bowled over now by the sweetness of love and how it doesn&#8217;t have to hurt or feel like you’re jumping into the darkness without a safety net and how you can love from a place of strength without losing parts of yourself, rather than going into battle and coming out with the scars.</p>\n<p>You learn what it’s like to love and be loved unconditionally, when you’re PMS’ing and grouchy, on your fat days and bad hair days, and the days when you’re tired and vulnerable and don’t want to get out of bed. You understand for the first time what it is to seek shelter in another’s arms, and that it is possible to trust, that what feels like the end often isn’t, and that everything is possible if you take a leap of faith.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You are 45</strong> when you start writing again, properly. By now, you have given up much in your life – sugar, alcohol, cigarettes, careless love affairs with careless men. You try to eat well, exercise regularly, dabble in meditation and yoga to calm the restless soul. Sometimes you miss the old you, the sense of freedom, the open roads, the unpredictability and terrible glamour of a life less lived.</p>\n<p>But by and large you think – and hope &#8211; this:</p>\n<p><em>Slowly, very slowly, you are coming home.</em></p>\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>You are 37 when you first fall in love &#8211; properly, passionately, the way you dreamed of when you scribbled furiously in your teenage notebooks and that has eluded you until precisely this moment in a dusty Cairo hotel.

He’s captured <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=max+becherer+war+images&amp;biw=1158&amp;bih=613&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQsARqFQoTCKCQ9sfphckCFQzRYwodX8YDBg\" target=\"_blank\">some of the most famous images</a> of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan — his C.V. is full of names like Baghdad and Fallujah — and in the process he’s repeatedly risked his life.</p>\n<p>A war photographer’s work is obviously taxing: While everyone around you is trying to either kill or survive, your job is to watch and record. Over time, it can take a toll on your humanity.</p>\n<p>But in Max’s case, exposure to war has actually <em>amplified</em> his humanity. In the decade he’s spent living and working in the Middle East, he’s somehow managed to look beyond the endless conflict and see the human beings whose lives unfold far beneath the headlines. Perhaps by being at the very epicenter of war he’s come to understand its far-reaching ripple effects.</p>\n<p>In Max’s own words,</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dynamite and Prayers is not about the people who wage war. It is a story about people who spend their lives living with war, and the pain that comes from watching one’s life be ruined by it even in the most beautiful place on earth.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s ironic, then, that I mistook the first image I saw from his new book for a man with a machine gun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-drill-blog.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"369\" data-permalink=\"http://heideblog.com/2009/06/18/seven-cities-in-10-days-part-6/florence-view-from-belltower-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-another-tower-view.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"504,378\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Heather Munro&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot S3 IS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1190379154&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;14.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0008&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Florence view from belltower 2&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Florence view from belltower 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-another-tower-view.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-another-tower-view.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-369\" src=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-drill-blog.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"Max Becherer drill BLOG\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a></p>\n<p>As Max explains <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/119006298\" target=\"_blank\">in this video</a>, it’s actually an apt comparison: With this drill, Ahmad Jawead is quite literally fighting for his life. But I won’t tell that story today (because I could never do Max’s work justice — and anyway, you should <a href=\"http://www.dynamiteandprayers.com/explore-select-pages/BookCoverPageLG/\" target=\"_blank\">see it for yourself</a>). So instead, today I’d like to pass on some of the stories and insights behind the book that Max has so graciously shared with me.</p>\n<p>Let’s start at the beginning …</p>\n<p><strong>What drew you to become a war journalist?</strong> [The] value of photojournalism is something I understood from a young age. Growing up, my mother would read us stories of Max and Moritz — a German children’s tale — which would spark my mother’s memory, and she would tell us stories from her childhood in Germany during the 1940s. … On [one] occasion, she said, she was taking shelter from an Allied bombing raid in the darkness of the basement of her apartment building. They heard a thunderous crash during the raid and did not dare move until the bombing was over. When the raid had completed they went to investigate … and discovered that a bomb had fallen through all three stories of their apartment building and rolled to a stop at the bottom of the stairs of the basement they were taking shelter in. The men of the group gathered the bomb up in blankets and carried it to the railroad tracks where the army collected unexploded bombs. In this way “story time” was also “history time” with my mother, but it was not until I was old enough to read and check out my own library books about World War II that I could start to understand the depth of what my mother experienced. In particular I felt the photographs from World War II had done the best job of relating her experience. From that experience I sought out a vocation that allowed me to help bridge the understanding from war zone to home front.</p>\n<p><strong>One of the key tenets of journalism is objectivity — but war depends on a clear “us versus them.” As a war journalist, how do you stay objective and not take sides?</strong> Stories are the most impactful when they intimately relate a perspective of a conflict. Relating many different stories that take the perspective of each the individual side of a conflict is one way to present a complete view of any given conflict. I feel the best service I can provide to readers is to leave as little interpretation as possible between what a subject relates to me and what I present. It is inevitable that a particular story will be biased by the subject, but by being able to relate both sides I give the viewer or reader the opportunity to judge the situation for themselves without my interpretation. In the case of this project I felt that the perspective of violence between the Taliban and the Afghan or international army is adequately represented to most viewers.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the most important lesson you learned about your fellow human by observing him/her at war?</strong> I think the idea that all humans are remarkably the same goes without saying, so I will add this observation: Humans are predictable and can therefore be anticipated. The trick of photojournalism is to be such a keen observer of humans that you can anticipate when a particular event will take place, allowing you to capture it. Photographing in war zones makes this skill particularly valuable because it can help you predict human behavior that may take your life. In the micro scale of this skill I am able to predict that a neighborhood bread stall that is empty and in hard mid-day light will be beautiful and busy with people in the early morning when family members are gathering their breakfast bread. [Or I can predict] that roadside bombs are often hidden in trash or on the opposite side of an obstacle placed in a walkway — so avoiding walking through trash or stepping far over or to the side of an obstacle in a trail will give me a better chance of not stepping on a land mine. In the macro version of this lesson I realize people are skilled observers of American foreign policy. This means that organizations like the Taliban often anticipate the 180-degree change in American foreign policy every time there is a new U.S. President, with remarkable success.</p>\n<p><strong>And by observing your fellow humans at war, what’s the most important lesson you learned about yourself?</strong> I think the most powerful realization was that making a list of small steps that I believe will lead me to accomplishing what I want will <em>actually</em> lead me to what I want. Knocking on a door, sending that email, reaching out for help is always the first step in going and doing the things I want to do.</p>\n<p><strong>How long did it take you to compile the images in your book? And how did you gain the Afghan miners’ trust and acceptance?</strong> The images for the book were created over the course of a two-week trip to the Panjshir mountains. However, the … intimacy of the images came because I had built a relationship over time with a member of the family of the miners. I had meet him in Kabul and worked with him as a translator and a guide. We had taken several dangerous trips together and we had grown to know each other very well. That made all the difference when I arrived in the valley to do the story because I was received as a guest of the village, and not as an outsider.</p>\n<h5><a href=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-author-pic-blog.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"371\" data-permalink=\"http://heideblog.com/2009/06/18/seven-cities-in-10-days-part-6/florence-dimedici-perspective/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-david-copy.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"359,504\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Heather Munro&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot S3 IS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1190402091&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;8.6&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Florence DiMedici perspective&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Florence DiMedici perspective\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-david-copy.jpg?w=214\" data-large-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-david-copy.jpg?w=359\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371\" src=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-author-pic-blog.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"Max Becherer author pic BLOG\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /><br />\n</a>Photographer Max Becherer, above, in the Panjshir mountains</h5>\n<p>I was housed in the home of a prominent family.

My host had suffered from the cold and the climbing so he’d stopped translating all of the miners’ stories. I think they figured that half of what they were telling me was being lost. But I was very diligent in making audio recordings of all their conversations, even the ones between each other. When I got back to Kabul and was rested I had all of their interviews transcribed and was in that way able to relate the richest and most meaningful stories. The were very grateful that I had recorded their stories so faithfully.</p>\n<h5><a href=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-mountainside-blog.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"370\" data-permalink=\"http://heideblog.com/2009/06/18/seven-cities-in-10-days-part-6/florence-view-from-belltower/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-belltower-interior.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"504,378\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Heather Munro&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot S3 IS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1190380132&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.02&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Florence view from belltower&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Florence view from belltower\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-belltower-interior.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://hmunro.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/florence-belltower-interior.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370\" src=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-mountainside-blog.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"Max Becherer mountainside BLOG\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /><br />\n</a>The landscape is beautiful, but the cold and altitude can take their toll on the miners.</h5>\n<p><strong>Your images of the <a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/buzkashi/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzkashi</a> tournament were breathtaking. How did you get these shots?</strong> These Buzkashi photographs have stood the test of time and are captivating every time I look at them. There are two images that stand out in particular from this series. The first image is the panorama of the horse riders chasing the leader with the “goat” on page 46. (I say “goat” because that is what is traditionally used even though in this case a calf was used.) This image was made as I was low to the ground, shooting up toward the riders, with a 200 mm lens on my camera that compressed the distance between the riders and the golden leaves of fall behind the riders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-get-the-goat-spread-blog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367\" src=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-get-the-goat-spread-blog.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"Max Becherer get the goat spread BLOG\" width=\"500\" height=\"206\" /></a></p>\n<p>On page 52 is an image that shows a rider in the heart of the scrum of horsemen as they fight each other for the “goat.” I made this image when the horsemen came barreling toward me and I found refuge on a large rock that was at the side of the field of play. The spectators around me had retreated up the hill. I stood fast on the boulder and used a 20mm lens to snap this image. This is one of those moments where I had to steady myself to keep shooting and was rewarded with a beautiful shot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-get-the-goat-blog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-366 size-full\" src=\"https://sporkblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/max-becherer-get-the-goat-blog.jpg?w=1016\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>In <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/119006298\" target=\"_blank\">the video on your blog</a>, you said you hoped this book would help raise awareness of the plight of the thousands of would-be refugees who are seeking a better life. What can the average American or European citizen do to help?</strong> I think internalizing that the people fleeing these places, for the most part, are desperate to go back to their home. As you can see from this book, many of them come from some of the most breathtaking places on earth. When you encounter these people in their community it is important to remember that if you were in their community they would offer you a seat inside their home and some tea and act as your host while you are in their community. This is a custom that is often only afforded to close family in our culture but it is a custom afforded to any traveler or stranger in their culture. This can translate into a simple act of helping refugees navigate your city or as elaborate as helping refugees navigate government services.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any stories behind any of the photos you’d especially like to share?</strong> The climb up the mountain takes the miners about four hours. They start off from the valley floor at first light with their supplies piled onto donkeys and make their mountain camps by noon. I was slow to start, so there were no more donkeys at the market to help me carry my week’s worth of supplies up the mountain. I was offered porters to carry my bags for me. I started up the mountain and the porters quickly left me in the dust. After four hours I was less than halfway up the mountain and the porters met me on their way down, my bags already safely delivered. They collected their pay from me and were on their way. I reached the camp that day just as the sun set.</p>\n<h3>Learn more</h3>\n<p>• See Max&#8217;s work at <a href=\"https://photonola.org/\" target=\"_blank\">PhotoNOLA</a>, <strong>December 10-13</strong>, Second Story Gallery, 2372 St. Claude Ave., New Orleans, Louisiana<br />\n• <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/Maxography?ref=search_shop_redirect\" target=\"_blank\">Purchase Max&#8217;s book and select prints on Etsy </a><br />\n• See more of Max&#8217;s work at <a href=\"http://www.maxbecherer.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.maxbecherer.com<br />\n</a>• Follow Max on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mlbecherer?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">@mlbecherer<br />\n</a>• Subscribe to <a href=\"https://maxbecherer.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Max&#8217;s WordPress blog</a></p>\n",

      "content": "<p>You know who else liked moustaches? I&#8217;ll tell you. Hitler. Stalin. Saddam. Gaddafi. Mussolini. That&#8217;s who. And here we are, being bullied into growing fanny dusters fit only for tyrants. Movember my ass. Having us walk around with moustaches for a month isn&#8217;t going to raise awareness of men&#8217;s health. All it will do is make women ridicule us even more than usual.</p>\n<p>You mightn&#8217;t be so quick to put out a welcome mat on the doorstep of Casa Nostrils if it wasn&#8217;t called a moustache, a word that has the ring of the usual French nonsense about it. But what if you lived in Germany, where a moustache is called a schnorrbart? Would you want to be associated with Schnorrvember? Or, if you&#8217;re in Iceland, Yfirvaraskeggvember? Never mind if you&#8217;re from Slovenia. Those poor bastards would have to celebrate Brkivember. The idea of three vowels in one word is enough to drive your average Slove to suicide.</p>\n<p>Normal people like me and perhaps you are not going to be pressured into cultivating a nasty habit that could well affect our political leanings and, indeed, our very sexuality. If Freddie Mercury had kept his top lip clean, he&#8217;d be living as Farrokh Bulsara in a trailer park in downtown Orlando today with a wife called Blanche and three gifted but disturbed children.</p>\n<p>Having said that, it&#8217;s interesting to note that gay bikers and heterosexual farmers alike are huge fans of the mouth brow. And yet if you had to walk into a bar and ask a biker if he&#8217;s a farmer or a farmer if he&#8217;s a bottie-bandit, you&#8217;d probably get your face broken.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t have a moustache because, in my line of work, it&#8217;s important to be trusted. People need to believe that what I write is the truth. If I am to be taken seriously, my upper lip needs to be dusted with nothing more than anxious beads of sweat. Unfortunately, and I don&#8217;t claim to know how this came about, men with moustaches cannot be trusted. I might lie through my teeth, but at least I don&#8217;t lie through my moustache as well.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. My face doesn&#8217;t always resemble a finely buffed piece of Carrara marble. If anyone ever makes a movie called Unshorn of the Dead, I&#8217;m their guy. Fact is, men who live alone tend to let themselves go from time to time. Especially those who make their living within the confines of their own home. Not that you can call this a living. Or even a home.</p>\n<p>This means my entire head is covered in fur for at least three weeks of the month. Not thick, coarse clumps of it. I&#8217;m not Chewbacca. Once there is a beard involved, though, the moustache ceases to be a moustache. It simply becomes part of a general facial flocculence that has been the defining feature of many of history&#8217;s lovable rogues ranging from Santa Claus to Charles Manson, from Jesus Christ to George Washington.</p>\n<p>I dislike my hairy face, but I like shaving even less. By week four I will catch sight of myself in a shop window and recoil. That&#8217;s when I buy a case of beer on a Friday night, turn up the music and have a one-man shaving party. Pathetic doesn&#8217;t come close.</p>\n<p>But what really gets my goat, apart from the stock thief in number nine, is that we allow these shadowy organisations to influence our decisions based on nebulous notions such as men&#8217;s health. I&#8217;m not even sure such a thing exists. Obviously I&#8217;m talking from first-hand experience here.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m reluctant to do this because I don&#8217;t get paid enough to involve myself in research, but apparently the idea of Movember originated in a bar in Adelaide in 1999. What a surprise. A bunch of Aussies off their faces decided that everyone should grow a moustache in November. Even the women, presumably, what with Australia being such an egalitarian society.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What if they don&#8217;t do it, Bruce?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, mate, we&#8217;ll cut off their goolies.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And roger all the Sheilas!&#8221;</p>\n<p>A stray dingo must have walked in at some point because the members of the freshly formed Movember Committee decided they&#8217;d sell T-shirts and give the money to animal welfare.</p>\n<p>Being Adelaide, there was no real rush to get things moving. The committee passed motions, water and out. The dingo eventually ate the treasurer and, in turn, was taken to the kitchen and converted into bar snacks. Such are the laws of nature.</p>\n<p>Five years went by and Movember, much like the committee, was still struggling to get to its feet. Meanwhile, a far sharper group of spritzer-drinking Aussies got together in Melbourne and started their own moustache-based event. Being more cunning and almost certainly more sober than the Adelaide mob, they linked theirs to a campaign to raise awareness for prostate cancer and depression in men.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But, honey, what about the …&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Shut up. Your lot doesn&#8217;t have a prostate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am depressed, though.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course you are. You don&#8217;t have a bloody prostate.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So these new blokes formed the Movember Foundation which spread quicker than typhoid. More than $174-million has been raised around the world since then. I don&#8217;t know where it’s gone. I like to think some went to shelters for women traumatised by having to kiss men with moustaches.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Movember merged with a testicular cancer event called Touchback. Quite frankly, I find the connotations of reciprocity disturbing. I don&#8217;t mind checking my own landing gear, but that&#8217;s where it ends.</p>\n<p>Few South African men suffer from intellectualism and we should perhaps point out to the common herd that growing a moustache in November does not constitute adequate protection against prostate cancer.</p>\n<p>Nor will the general health of men magically improve by a mass sprouting of soup strainers, no matter what the witches and warlocks of Limpopo province say. We might, however, be healthier if we didn&#8217;t have to work so damn hard. When I say we, I mean men who aren&#8217;t me. Men are becoming increasingly stressed by roadblocks and paternity tests. We get depressed by speed limits and flea markets. So let&#8217;s tackle the real issues first.</p>\n<p>Movember&#8217;s main man in South Africa, Garron Gsell, if that&#8217;s his real name, says there&#8217;s a stigma around diseases that affect men, impacting on early detection and life expectancy. Never mind the bollocks. There&#8217;s a stigma around men, period. And early detection of a doomed marriage can also greatly improve life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Gsell says the underlying message of this year&#8217;s theme is that &#8220;if you choose to live well and follow a healthy lifestyle … you can help shape your future&#8221;. In other news, if you wear shoes you can avoid getting thorns in your feet. Also, using an umbrella in the rain can help you stay dry. And not drinking a bottle of brandy for breakfast is good for you.</p>\n<p>Finally, let us not forget that the biggest cause of depression among men is an inability to grow a moustache in November. Mo-shaming is a real thing. So if you do come across someone without a moustache, try to restrain yourself from smashing a beer glass into his face. He might not be a contumacious misanthropic iconoclast at all. He might, for instance, be unable to grow a moustache because he&#8217;s had radiotherapy to treat testicular cancer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1709\" data-permalink=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.wordpress.com/2015/11/08/hairy-lips-mean-healthy-balls/mask/\" data-orig-file=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg?w=480\" data-orig-size=\"235,247\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6 Plus&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1445444066&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.15&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.03030303030303&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mask\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg?w=480?w=235\" data-large-file=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg?w=480?w=235\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1709\" src=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"mask\" srcset=\"https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg 235w, https://bentrovatowhippingboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mask.jpg?w=143 143w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\"   /></a></p>\n",

      "short_URL": "https://wp.me/pgXAi-1n0",
      "content": "<p>In Ancient Greek mythology, the Earth Goddess Gaia had nine titan sons, who attempted to control not just the Earth, but the entire Universe. I’d like to introduce another. It’s a new creature who emerged only in recent decades. But it’s a creature who is already as influential over life on the planet as the phytoplankton or forests that regulate global temperature, the weather and the air we breathe.</p>\n<p>That new creature is us, or more precisely, what humanity is becoming. The entirety of our species, <i>Homo sapiens</i>, is evolving into a superorganism; I’ll call this new life force <i>Homo omnis</i>, or ‘Homni’.</p>\n<p>We have now become the dominant force shaping our planet. Some say that because of our actions we have entered a new geological epoch: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-welcome-to-the-age-of-modern-man\">the Anthropocene</a>, or the age of man. Homni is a product of this age, a product of human industrialisation, population expansion, globalisation and the revolution in communications technology, and he is immensely powerful. Homni can influence the biosphere, and has needs – currently, he uses <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm\">18 terawatts</a> (trillion watts) of energy at any time, <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-science-how-much-water-nations-consume/\">9,000 billion cubic metres of water</a> per year, <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.html\">40% of global land area</a> for farming, and a plethora of other natural and mineral resources.</p>\n<p>Only time will tell if he will be a benign caretaker, or a monster that destroys life and with it himself. But there are clues, and here I will examine what Homni is, and what he means for our species, the planet and the rest of life on Earth.</p>\n<p><b>Crowd power</b></p>\n<p>To understand Homni, let me first take you down into the soil to consider one of the most simple and ancient single-celled organisms, an amoeba called a slime mould. It evolved some 600 million years ago, and occupies soils across the world, from Antarctica to the Arctic. For most of its life-cycle, the cell lives the unexceptional life of most amoeba. But sometimes, these single cells <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/science/04slime.html?pagewanted=all\">gather in their thousands to create an organism</a>, encased in its own slime, that can creep, crawl, pulsate, grow tentacles and even negotiate a maze.</p>\n<p>Scientists describe these slime moulds as ‘societies’ because of the way the individual amoebae work together towards a common cause, sometimes sacrificing themselves on the way. For example, if food is scarce in their soil patch, the amoeba coalesce together forming a tendril that creeps up to the light. Once it has reached the surface, a portion of them form a stalk above ground, by turning their bodies into hard cellulose – a process that kills them. The rest of the mould then climbs the stalk and waits in a blob at the top for a passing animal to transport them to new soils. All this, from the simplest organism.</p>\n<p>The human brain is a bit like the mould. Each single brain cell, or neuron, cannot be described as conscious or sentient, and yet, when all 86 billion neurons are networked together, the human brain is far, far more than the sum of its parts, capable of thinking and processing ideas in original ways. We still don’t understand how thoughts or personality or behaviours are seeded and take root in this network, or how the neurons become organised to drive such processes, but somehow consciousness is created from the most prosaic building materials.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"5279\" data-permalink=\"http://wanderinggaia.com/2014/07/08/homni-the-new-superorganism-taking-over-earth/rocina/\" data-orig-file=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"333,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rocina\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg?w=333\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5279\" src=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg?w=199&#038;h=300\" alt=\"rocina\" width=\"199\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg?w=199&amp;h=300 199w, https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg?w=100&amp;h=150 100w, https://wanderinggaia.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/rocina.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We can describe the intelligence, creativity and sociability of Homni as being comparable to the networked, linked-up, conversational accumulation of all the human brains, including those from the past who have left a cultural and intellectual legacy, and also the artificial ‘brains’ of our technological inventions, such as computer programs and Wikipedia. Homni is a global network of civilisations with a stream of knowledge already being channelled for human protection. Just as a cloud of starlings suddenly flips direction en masse, it is difficult to predict how Homni’s behaviour will play out.</p>\n<p>But this is just one aspect of Homni.</p>\n<p><b>&#8216;Artificial Man&#8217;</b></p>\n<p>Not long ago, I sat in a rainforest in Belize, watching a troop of fire ants at work. Individually, each is a formidable beast, a few centimetres long but with a powerful bite. But together, they form what entomologist EO Wilson described as a superorganism of thousands of organised ants that systematically devours everything in its path, tearing down trees and crops and stripping the insulation off wiring and other electrical equipment. In some places the ants run a protection racket for other aphids and bugs, <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/12/05/fire-ants-conquered-america-by-monopolising-calorie-rich-food/#more-5921\">which supply them with nectar</a>. And the superorganism has even figured out a way of surviving heavy rainfall, by clinging to each other and <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/19/7669.long\">forming a floating life raft</a> in times of flooding. Once they’ve exhausted their environment’s resources, the entire community ups and moves to pastures new. Ants are sophisticated farmers – pre-dating human farmers by more than 50 million years – and they also raise and milk livestock (aphids), they build complex residences, keep slaves, and wage massive battles that involve psychological warfare. The comparisons with humans are multiple.</p>\n<p>Applying the idea of superorganisms to humanity is more complicated – individually, we are more autonomous than cells, or even ants. But over the centuries, the idea has emerged in many different guises. The Ancient Greeks imagined each of us as cells in the greater being. Others have referred to the roles that different parts of society play – such as generating energy or food – as analogous to organs in a body. The 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes also described society as forming an &#8216;Artificial Man&#8217; that functions (through civilisation) in a way as to ensure its own survival.</p>\n<p>Now, as we advance into the Anthropocene, we are seeing these ideas put into practice on an unprecedented scale. While individual humans or societies can exert a local or regional effect on landscapes, water flow or biodiversity, the impact of our superspecies is planetary. Homni now controls three-quarters of Earth’s freshwater supplies, has modified <a href=\"http://ecotope.org/people/ellis/papers/ellis_2008.pdf\">more than three-quarters</a> of ice-free land surface, and modulates the planet&#8217;s air, biodiversity, and oceanic chemistry and biology. Homni has even started <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120518-danger-space-junk-alert\">littering space</a> with telescopes, satellites and other artificial junk. Homni’s actions are like the environmental rampaging of Argentinian ants on a global scale.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, individual people are less and less able to function independently in modern society – we rely on the superorganism to feed, clothe and power our many tools, to inform and heal us, even to help us reproduce through surrogacy or IVF. In coming decades, it is likely that access to the internet will have reached <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140214-the-last-places-without-internet\">almost every part of the globe</a> and, as we become more cohesive as a networked society, individuals who remain outside of the new superorganism will find themselves isolated culturally and technologically from what it means to be a human in the Anthropocene.</p>\n<p>In the coming decades, it is also likely that access to electricity, sanitation and antibiotics will become near universal – thus, describing a human in the Anthropocene will increasingly assume a doubled lifespan and basic awareness of the scientific, geopolitical, cultural and social factors behind how the world operates. The result will be a new way of living that is almost akin to being a new subspecies. It is the new modern human that created the Anthropocene and gave rise to Homni, but it is Homni who now sculpts the new human.</p>\n<p><b>Monster issues</b></p>\n<p>And here lies an interesting paradox. Humans may have evolved through a process of natural selection – essentially outcompeting rivals to death – but as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/apr/04/tim-flannery-global-shared-beliefs-video\">palaeontologist Tim Flannery</a> says, this has led not to a &#8220;dog-eat-dog world&#8221;, but to a cooperative society. He believes we are in the process of forming an interdependent global society with a set of shared beliefs – a &#8220;civilisation of ideas&#8221; – that will transform Earth into a more equitable and ecologically curated planet. It&#8217;s an optimistic view of Homni, based on the fact that most people want to get on with each other and look after their neighbourhood environment. Whether, or to what degree, Flannery&#8217;s altruistic view of humanity bears out is the big question.</p>\n<p>Individuals may exert an influence over Homni to some degree, rather like the single neuron that fires off a signal, starting an original thought, which then progresses to a painting, song or an invention like the iPod. Or the individual who sends a single tweet that then becomes an internet meme propagating and evolving through the internet. The “tipping point” is thought to be low: just 10% are needed to hold a new belief before it <a href=\"http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/2902\">spreads to the majority of the population</a>.</p>\n<p>Although individuals may be able to steer Homni to some level, it is far from obvious how we might do this to ensure our survival through the Anthropocene. Homni’s influence is already being seen in planetary changes unprecedented for millions of years, affecting humans and our relationship to the natural world. We are changing the climate by increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; we&#8217;re reducing the planet&#8217;s biodiversity, causing what scientists fear may be the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7336/full/nature09678.html\">sixth mass extinction</a> in its history; and terraforming Earth&#8217;s land surface with multiple megacities of concrete, steel and glass. Deciding as an individual to reduce freshwater waste, or cut my carbon footprint has negligible impact on the state of the world&#8217;s rivers or global temperature.</p>\n<p>Homni is essentially a concept – I invented him because our superorganism has characteristics that go beyond the simple accumulation of humans. In other examples from the animal world, like bee hives or ant nests, killing the queen results in the collapse of the entire colony. Homni has no single queen, though, and in this way he is as robust as a forest. It would take a catastrophe on an epic scale – an epidemic, massive environmental change, an asteroid impact, or nuclear war – to possibly kill Homni, leaving a straggle of human survivors.</p>\n<p>But our impulse would always be to strengthen rather than kill Homni – we are social collaborators and most of our recent discoveries, inventions and successes have been born out of group effort. And the secret to ensuring a better Anthropocene is in recognising Homni&#8217;s power, but also nurturing his human side, the side committed to improving relations with the neighbours and cleaning up the neighbourhood. Will we achieve this through global international agreements? Possibly. I think that increasingly, as we see through a network of eyes, in the form of the many powerful satellites and remote cameras that track individual trees in rainforests or reveal the extent of glacial carving, we will start to read Homni’s mind, and have more nuanced control over his actions.</p>\n<p>Maybe then we will begin to use the power of Homni to restore and curate the planet. The alternative is too monstrous to contemplate.</p>\n<p><em>This article <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140701-the-superorganism-engulfing-earth\" target=\"_blank\">first appeared on BBC Future</a>.

Many are scarcely wide enough for a single car to pass people on foot.</p>\n<p>Even at this early hour, when I reach the big thoroughfare (which <em>might</em> be Lazimpat Rd., Google Maps seems as confused as I am), it&#8217;s already a loud, hectic scene. With no painted lane markers or stoplights for guidance, the streets are an untamed river of wheels: weaving motorbikes, overstuffed and swaying local buses, bicycles loaded with everything from live chickens to clear blue jugs of water, a few cars, and the odd dust-glazed tuk tuk.</p>\n<p>At a corner I stop and scan zooming headlights for approaching taxis to take me to Kathmandu Airport.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m anxiously aware that getting a taxi could be a difficult feat at the moment. A fuel shortage caused by neighboring India&#8217;s politically motivated withholding of petrol has obliged many Nepalis to wait in petrol station lines for up to 24 hours. Unsurprisingly, fuel prices have been driven to unfathomable levels in under a week. Using a car is now such a costly endeavor that it has forced many taxi drivers off the road, or to charge exorbitant fares.</p>\n<p>But I have little choice.</p>\n<p>Two bicycle tuk tuk drivers, one taller and one shorter, parked at the corner press me to take a ride. The taller one asks, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;To the airport.&#8221; I say, &#8220;But I have to get there very quickly. I need a car taxi.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can take,&#8221; the shorter one offers, &#8220;is no problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s too far and tuk tuk isn&#8217;t fast enough. I need to be there in 20 minutes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They keep after me for a bit longer, but eventually go sulky and silent when I resort to ignoring them. Finally I manage to flag down a tiny beat-up white taxi car. While the driver maneuvers a cramped turn-around, the two tuk tuk guys engage him through his rolled-down window. Just as we&#8217;re inching to merge into traffic, it seems something they&#8217;ve said has struck home and it causes the driver to abruptly halt the car. He twists in his seat and tells me I have to get out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why, what happened?<em>&#8220;</em> I ask, hesitantly exiting.</p>\n<p>He says simply, &#8220;This not a taxi now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it was a taxi two seconds ago&#8230; please, I have to get to the airport!&#8221; I utter futilely into the car&#8217;s exhaust cloud.</p>\n<p>After a second, the taller tuk tuk driver looks at me smugly, &#8220;<em>You need ride?</em>&#8221;</p>\n<p>I glare at him. Indignantly, I trudge a half block up to renew my taxi search. I know that if I don&#8217;t make this flight, I will miss the only day for at least a week that, according to weather reports, will be clear enough to see what I&#8217;ve come to see.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-XBNg7Rq/0/M/Mt.%20Everest-4-M.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p>By no small miracle, I make it to the airport via taxi, get through security, and board the small, 20-odd seater Yeti Airlines plane by exactly 6:30am. At 6:45, the other tourists and I lift gently from the runway and are in the air, flying over the enormous, hazy city into a pale ocean of clouds.</p>\n<p>After about 10 minutes of nearly audible anticipation, a chatter of excitement cascades through the cabin. I peer through my window and spy distant mountains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-GbDhvV9/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-13-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Everest!&#8221; somebody near the front shouts. Our lone flight attendant, Sunita, dressed in a traditional Nepalese-inspired marigold and green outfit, sashays up the aisle, pausing every couple of rows to correct the shouter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That peak is Langtang Mountain. 7,234 meters high.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;When will we see Everest?&#8221; an Australian man behind me asks.</p>\n<p>Sunita smiles patiently. &#8220;It will be a short while before we can see it. We must first pass other mountains of this range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pressing my forehead to the glass like a child, I watch, mesmerized as the startlingly lovely Himalayas glide by outside the window beneath beams of morning sunlight. At times they resemble vast fields of toothed jaws biting up through white whisps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-WNvX596/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-62-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>At other times, they become spectral giants sleeping side by side, sloped bodies echoing to the horizon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-FqPK6VQ/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-74-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"508\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-CQgpHCX/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-80-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-5SLv53Z/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-1-3-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sunita taps me on the shoulder. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting close, do you want to go into the cockpit to see it?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I nod, grab my camera and work my way to the front of the plane. A thin, bespectacled Korean guy in his twenties is snapping away, standing directly over the shoulders of the pilots. I can&#8217;t help thinking that there is no way in hell so many people would be able to get this close to airplane pilots flying in the U.S. One little bump of the arm, or a dropped camera&#8230;</p>\n<p>The Korean guy backs out of the small space, and I move in. The co-pilot looks up from the hundreds of buttons in the cockpit (<em>I would never let me, or anybody else get this close to those things!</em> I think) and greets me with a typical warm Nepalese &#8220;Namaste.&#8221; He point toward the left window at a small triangle-shaped peak in the distance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is Everest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>My breath catches in my chest, and for a moment my mind becomes a broken record: <em>Wow&#8230; wow&#8230; wow&#8230;</em></p>\n<p>At last I snap out of it, raised my camera to my eye and began to shoot. The buttons and pilots and even the airplane itself fades away, and it&#8217;s just me and the mountain through my lens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-JHFNRHH/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-26-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"498\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-4S5JDpp/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-45-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-L3ZCMbv/0/L/Mt.%20Everest-40-L.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"481\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-ZChrh8k\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.kirstenasmithphotography.com/Global-Travels/Nepal/Mt-Everest/i-hJzSfz5/0/XL/Mt.%20Everest-54-XL.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"768\" /></a>Back in my seat, I&#8217;m half delirious from the experience of actually seeing something of this magnitude (in every sense), this mystical mountain which I never even seriously considered I&#8217;d ever get to see with my own eyes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1024\" data-permalink=\"http://wallflowerwanderer.com/2015/10/11/my-mt-everest/me-on-everest-airplane/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"960,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 5&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1443597074&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;2.18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;80&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Me on Everest Airplane\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1024\" src=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" alt=\"Me on Everest Airplane\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://thewallflowerwanderer.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/me-on-everest-airplane.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a>I hear a muted popping sound over the whir of the propellers and look back to see Sunita filling glass flutes with champagne, which she passes to each of us in celebration.

It was the McCulloch&#8217;s first crossing (first safari too) and I was anxious to see their reaction. They loved the sightings we had in the first 24 hours: giraffe, zebra, ostrich, a rare pangolin, but I knew this would blow them away.</p>\n<p>To cross, the wildebeest would have to navigate a gauntlet of rock-strewn rapids. Carcasses littering the stones, some bloated and split from decay, others as stiff as upended mannequins, spoke of the dangers the wildebeest faced. Every now and then the wind would change and we&#8217;d get a whiff of the foul, gag-inducing stench.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_31642\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"31642\" data-permalink=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/2015/11/17/the-drama-the-suspense-the-thrill-of-a-wildebeest-crossing-the-mara-river-in-kenya/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,693\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;36&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Susan Portnoy&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1443449847&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Susan Portnoy&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;519&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Wildebeest and zebra running from the Mara River, Kenya&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=480\" class=\"size-full wp-image-31642\" src=\"https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"Wildebeest and zebra running from the Mara River, Kenya\" srcset=\"https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=480 480w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=960 960w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=150 150w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=300 300w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-11.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wildebeest and zebra, spooked by who knows what, run from the edge of the water up a hill near the Mara River.

Each year, from July through October (give or take a few weeks), millions of wildebeest journey during the Great Migration from Tanzania to Kenya and back again, chasing the rain and the grass that grows in its wake. Snaking through the countryside, the Mara River is a daunting obstacle the wildebeest must cross in their search for food, risking injury, or death by drowning, crocodiles or opportunistic lions and leopards that lay in wait. The migration is a giant moveable feast that predators count on again and again.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_31634\" style=\"width: 1210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"31634\" data-permalink=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/2015/11/17/the-drama-the-suspense-the-thrill-of-a-wildebeest-crossing-the-mara-river-in-kenya/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;7.1&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Susan Portnoy&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS-1D X&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1443376163&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Susan Portnoy&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;490&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.000625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Topi cross the Mara River with wildebeest in Kenya&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://theinsatiabletraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=480\" class=\"size-full wp-image-31634\" src=\"https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"Topi cross the Mara River with wildebeest in Kenya\" srcset=\"https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=480 480w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=960 960w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://insatiabletravelerdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/wildebeest-crossing-in-masai-mara-kenya-2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A small herd of topi cross with the wildebeest</p></div>\n<h3><strong>And the wildebeest crossing begins!<br />\n</strong></h3>\n<p>A single wildebeest shot through the air, its front hooves tucked neatly under its chest, its powerful, spindly legs propelling it 10 feet into the river.

You could see their massive heads cut through the water like a shark fin as they locked on to their target. You could see it coming and yet you could do nothing but watch with a sense of dread. It was nature in its cruelest form. I was a mix of emotions. I hated the idea that an animal was going to die, but I couldn&#8217;t deny that I was also fascinated by the spectacle that is the circle of life.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\"

In the video, Feuerstein claims that Starbucks wanted to &#8220;take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups&#8221; because, according to the caption on his video, &#8220;they hate Jesus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Feuerstein goes on to explain that when he visited a Starbucks store, he told the employee making his drink that his name was &#8220;Merry Christmas&#8221; so that his cup would read &#8220;Merry Christmas.&#8221; He later says &#8220;Guess what, Starbucks? Just to offend you, I made sure to wear my Jesus Christ shirt into your store, and, since you hate the 2nd Amendment, I even carried my gun!&#8221; Three days after the initial post of the video, it has over 130,000 likes and 380,000 shares. Feuerstein has started a #MerryChristmasStarbucks campaign in which he urges other Christians to post pictures of themselves performing the same prank in an effort to stick it to Starbucks and keep &#8220;CHRIST&#8221; in Christmas.</p>\n<p>This, my friends, is complete and utter ignorance.</p>\n<p>This, my friends, is the reason my fellow students at Colorado State University think I&#8217;ll hate them when I tell them I&#8217;m a Christian.</p>\n<p>This, my friends, is why my African-American brothers and sisters are left begging for answers from an evangelical community who turns a blind eye to their suffering.</p>\n<p>This, my friends, is everything wrong with American Christianity.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: I&#8217;m now a Starbucks employee. I&#8217;m also a follower of Jesus. I also have no issues with the new plain red Starbucks holiday cups. As I start my job as a barista at Starbucks in the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll probably familiarize my taste buds with the Starbucks Christmas blend &#8211; yes, Christmas blend &#8211; by drinking from these plain red cups.</p>\n<p>I do have issues with #MerryChristmasStarbucks, though. Most of American Christianity&#8217;s blatant problems are exposed in this one excruciatingly real social campaign.</p>\n<p>First, I&#8217;ll take us back to WWJD. Yep, the four letters that perpetually encircled your wrist if you grew up as a Christian kid in the &#8217;90s. I can certainly tell you that if Jesus walked into a Starbucks store and found that their new cups celebrating the occasion of his very own birthday were simplified to a new plain red look, he wouldn&#8217;t have boycotted the store. He wouldn&#8217;t have told the employees his name was &#8220;Happy Birthday Jesus&#8221; so that they&#8217;d <em>have </em>to glorify him by writing the phrase on his cup. He wouldn&#8217;t have done <em>anything</em> &#8220;just to offend&#8221; them. Instead, he probably would&#8217;ve done something like what my good friend Caleb wrote in a Facebook post concerning the #MerryChristmasStarbucks campaign:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;If Jesus was to walk the earth today and enter the nearest Starbucks, what would his agenda be? Would he zero in on the closest employee and tell them to write, “Merry Christmas” on his peppermint mocha? Would he then smile smugly at the pained barista who had nothing to do with the corporation’s decision to implement a new design? Would he later boast about it to all his friends as they marvel at his moral victory?</em></p>\n<p><em>Or perhaps Jesus would choose to order his coffee and ask the barista how her day has been. Perhaps he would invite her to sit with him during her break so he could get to know her. Christian, would he not choose to love her? Invite her to church, tell her what he did for her on the cross, explain grace and mercy, ask how he could serve her with the same humility he demonstrated 2000 years ago?</em></p>\n<p><em>Christ is our example in all things, including everyday interactions that may seem inconsequential. Let us not lose sight of that this Christmas season, and let us boast in Christ and Christ alone as we live in a world, country, and state that is not our home and never will be.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Beautiful. Profound. This looks more like the Jesus I know. This looks like a more accurate answer to &#8220;WWJD&#8221; than choosing to &#8220;offend&#8221; Starbucks and their disdain for the 2nd Amendment. As I consider what Jesus would have done upon walking into a Starbucks and finding a simplified red cup, a word I&#8217;ve been pondering lately comes to mind.</p>\n<p>That word is <strong>meekness</strong>.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s meekness? Good question. It&#8217;s a tough term to define. I once heard Jefferson Bethke (a dude whose biblical stances on social issues I&#8217;d recommend paying attention to, by the way) call meekness &#8220;the inability to be offended.&#8221; That struck me hard, because I&#8217;m someone who struggles with being easily offended. Meekness is an extremely difficult characteristic to develop, because&#8230; what about my pride? What about my &#8216;being right?&#8217; What about the fact that American corporations are trying to take Christ out of Christmas?</p>\n<p>Meekness, however, is a fruit of the Spirit. In the Beatitudes, Jesus says &#8220;blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth&#8221; (Matthew 5:5). When Jesus went to the cross and died for my sins, your sins, and the sins of Starbucks&#8217; governing board, he showed the epitome of meekness. When he saw the sins of the world, he wasn&#8217;t offended. Instead, he was heartbroken. He went to the cross with full knowledge that Starbucks&#8217; corporate decision-makers would one day change their holiday cups to a simple red design in an apparent attempt to take his name out of the season that exists only because of him. He subsequently died for their sins anyway, in hopes that they, too, would accept the free gift of his all-consuming love and live with him for eternity.</p>\n<p>When we&#8217;re offended that Starbucks changes their cups, we completely fail to show the Christlike characteristic of meekness. Instead, we <em>settle</em> for the moral upper hand.</p>\n<p>Another reason #MerryChristmasStarbucks is everything wrong with American Christianity is its improper, miscalculated expectation of Christian values from a non-Christian entity. Simply put, Starbucks is not a Christ-centered company. That doesn&#8217;t make Starbucks bad. In fact, Starbucks employees &#8211; many of whom are Christians, like myself &#8211; often show Christlike characteristics in their jobs, even if they do so unknowingly. Starbucks is a very friendly, comfortable place where millions of Americans enjoy drinking tasty coffee.</p>\n<p>What Starbucks&#8217; position as a secular entity does imply, though, is that we shouldn&#8217;t expect the corporation to make decisions based on Christian tradition or Christian values. What if Starbucks&#8217; holiday cups were black? What if they featured upside-down crosses? What if they were embroidered with pentagrams? If these outlandish scenarios were in fact realities, I&#8217;d hope that Christians would be no less surprised &#8211; and no less offended &#8211; at the changes. Yet at the simple change to red, we&#8217;re shocked, offended, and filled with an anger that&#8217;s anything but righteous.</p>\n<p>American Christianity has adopted the unfair, improper, and potentially hurtful position that non-Christians should somehow live by Christian moral standards before Christians show love to them. &#8220;If we fix their behavior, we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em,&#8221; we think. Did we forget the words of Romans 5:8, that God <em>presently </em>and <em>continuously</em> demonstrates his love to us because <i>&#8220;while we were still sinners, Christ died for us?&#8221; </i></p>\n<p>This is sick and twisted. Jesus loved us while we were at our worst. In fact, in the words of Matt Chandler, without Jesus, even <em>at our best </em>we were utterly offensive to God! But he still loved us as his own, still chose us, and still appointed us to be representatives of his sacrificial love. Sadly, we&#8217;ve chosen to settle for spreading around our political opinions, allowing ourselves to be filled with pride after our preaching to the choir garners praise from those who already agree with us. We&#8217;ve settled for the sickness and self-righteousness of moralistic therapeutic deism rather than the life-changing and eternally powerful message of the Gospel. We&#8217;ve settled for religiosity, which frankly doesn&#8217;t attract anyone to Jesus. Instead, our moralism repels potential believers while we high-five our fellow Christians for sticking it to the man.</p>\n<p>News flash: Jesus already stuck it to the man named death so that we wouldn&#8217;t have to. Stop expecting somebody to behave like you and agree with you before you love them. If Jesus expected perfect behavior out of you as a requirement for spending eternity with him, you&#8217;d be doomed from the start.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Boko Haram has killed 3,500 people in terrorist attacks in Africa this year, many of which have targeted Christians. Up to 340,000 people have been killed in the crisis ravaging Syria over the last four years. ISIS continues to target both Christians and Muslims as it terrorizes the Middle East. Don&#8217;t forget, about 30 million people are currently stuck in the horrors of modern slavery. Let&#8217;s also add the racial injustice that&#8217;s drowning America in turmoil.</p>\n<p>James 1:27 says &#8220;Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But hey, have you seen those new Christ-less Starbucks cups?</p>\n",
      "excerpt": "<p>A few days ago, former pastor Joshua Feuerstein posted a video announcing a campaign against Starbucks due to their switch from festive holiday cups in previous years to a new plain red look for the 2015 holiday season. In the video, Feuerstein claims that Starbucks wanted to &#8220;take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups&#8221; because, [&hellip;]</p>\n",

The outsider examines Indigenous philosophy by thoughtfully interacting with the Indigenous philosopher.” </em></p>\n<p><em><em>— Thurman Lee Hester Jr. and Dennis McPherson, &#8220;The Euro-American Philosophical Tradition and its Ability to Examine Indigenous Philosophy&#8221;<sup><a id=\"ref1\" href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup></em></em></p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">With the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report on residential schools in June 2015, “Indigenizing the Academy” is a hot topic in Canadian universities. As institutions explore the introduction of Indigenous content, we have to question <i>what </i>is defined as Indigenous content, <i>who</i> this content serves, and <i>how</i> the pursuit of “indigenizing the academy” can easily become exploitative.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2013, I helped put together a new syllabus for an Indigenous Philosophy class at my university. The philosophy department wouldn’t consider allowing someone without a PhD in philosophy teach this course, but pairing an Indigenous undergrad with a white philosophy professor was, apparently, acceptable. (Oh, the power dynamics.) Aware of the limitations of our knowledge, we created a course that was largely guest speakers: a roster of amazing Indigenous scholars and elders. This couldn’t have been done, practically or ethically, without immense support from the Indigenous Studies faculty.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many canonical European philosophers &#8211; Hegel, Kant, Locke, to name a few &#8211; saw Indigenous peoples as lacking agency, and incapable of intellectual thought. This is the history that the discipline of philosophy inherits, but far from being a legacy, philosophy is still used as a way to signify whose knowledges are legitimate and whose are invalid.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The portrayal of Indigenous thought as simplistic, primitive, and unarticulated is key in the erasure and justification of genocide.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"671\" data-permalink=\"http://moontimewarrior.com/2015/11/09/who-can-teach-indigenous-philosophy/descartes/\" data-orig-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/descartes.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"960,717\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1426722717&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/descartes.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/descartes.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-671 size-large\" src=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/descartes.jpg?w=480&#038;h=359\" alt=\"Photograph of a collage of Rene Descartes, juxtaposed with an image of a black man with a machete, so it appears that Descartes is about to be attacked.

Text reads: “modern philosophy is largely a reaction to Descartes”)</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A Case Study in Classroom Colonialism</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Originally, &#8220;Indigenous Philosophy 115&#8221; was registered as a course by a white professor in the philosophy department. Multiple Indigenous scholars on campus were curious about this class and contacted the philosophy department, but attempts for clarification regarding his experience or qualifications to teach Indigenous content proved unsatisfactory.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This September, I decided to sit in on the class with a few friends, and I took notes on the experience. (A bit of ethnography, if you will.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Field Notes: Indigenous Fauxlosophy</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Day One: September 4, 2015</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">1. The professor starts the class, <b>&#8220;Philosophy is not so much about learning about history, I want to know what you think and feel about the issues”.</b> A statement like this wouldn&#8217;t fly in any other philosophy class, of course. While universities may have just “discovered” Indigenous philosophy, these knowledges are vast, complex, unique to nations, and well-understood by community knowledge keepers.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">2. <b>&#8220;I like going into a class where I can make my own views. Not just memorize this, memorize this. Well, what about ME?&#8221; </b>The hard, selfless life of a white guy in philosophy. Never hearing your history, having your knowledges mutilated by outsiders. Wait, what?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">3. <b>&#8220;In philosophy we study pros &amp; cons, different views. In my ethics class I taught about homosexuality from both pro &amp; con perspectives.&#8221;</b> Some students shift uncomfortably in their desks. In philosophy, so often, the lives of marginalized people are reduced to thought experiments. (I wrote about this <a href=\"http://moontimewarrior.com/2014/03/27/good-philosophers-dont-have-anxiety-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">4. “<b>The United States didn&#8217;t <i>give</i> any title to Natives. They have reservations, that&#8217;s it.&#8221; </b>A fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of Indigenous sovereignty.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">5. We begin the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwgjXa-6KTCHRGpBa0JUMnZOZGs/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">reading</a>. He reduces the story to how the Penobscot author is lacking self-esteem as a Native in a &#8220;<b>new place</b>”. All the vast, beautiful, endless worlds of Indigenous knowledge to choose from &amp; he starts the entire class with how Native women apparently &#8220;<b>lack self-esteem</b>”.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">6. <b>&#8220;Eunice was from Maine, Penobscot, an group that has been there &#8211; well, <em>since contact</em> […] which is impressive because not many Natives were there. How many Natives are in Manhattan now? Washington D.C.? None!&#8221; </b>False.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">7. The professor’s explanation of Indigenous governance: <b>“It was like university, faculty get together with Robert’s Rules of Order, everyone had input.” </b>False. Bonus points: I know a lot of faculty who would disagree with that assessment of democratic university governance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">8. The last note I wrote down: while discussing the benefits of an authoritarian model of government: <b>“People feel valued when someone takes charge […] there&#8217;s less bumbling around, things get done, houses get built”</b>. (If you&#8217;re interested in substantial discussions of how First Nations are confronting lack of safe housing as a real problem rooted in systematic underfunding, check out the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OneHouseManyNations\" target=\"_blank\">One House, Many Nations</a> project.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Day Two: September 9, 2015</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We discuss capitalism. A back-and-forth interaction:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A student raises the issue of the Oka Crisis. <span class=\"s2\">The professor&#8217;s response: <b>“Well the issue there was a golf course. That was local.”</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Student replies: &#8220;The issue was colonization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The professor replies: <strong>&#8220;Colonization and a golf course. [&#8230;] those are very particular disputes. Like New Calendonia. That&#8217;s a little area of land that the people of Six Nations want, but the people in that area don&#8217;t want to give up.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the author is thinking just of Indigenous people as suffering. There&#8217;s all sorts of people who are suffering.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Student replies: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this an issue of white supremacy?&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The professor says: <strong>&#8220;Why would you say white supremacy? [&#8230;] Global capitalism now is racially neutral. [&#8230;] Capitalism goes beyond issues of colonialism or race.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Day Three: September 11, 2015</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">We spend the entire class studying the new-agey, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Profiles-Wisdom-Native-Elders-Speak/dp/0595144845\" target=\"_blank\">super questionable course text</a> and the words of a woman who claims to be Seneca. A quick Google search finds little content other than discussion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_shaman\" target=\"_blank\">plastic shamans</a>. I raise this issue at the end of the class; the professor’s response is <strong>“well, she says she’s Seneca!” </strong>I wish I had <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129554-400-there-is-no-dna-test-to-prove-youre-native-american/\" target=\"_blank\">Kim TallBear</a> or <a href=\"https://tequilasovereign.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/rachel-dolezal-and-andrea-smith/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanne Barker </a>here beside me, right now. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>[[Update, Nov 10:</strong> A woman who is part of the author&#8217;s community contacted me to vouch for her. Unfortunately, it appears that some facilitators are carrying out &#8220;Native American&#8221; teachings in her name (in workshops that cost hundreds of euros) now that she is passed. As a non-Seneca, it&#8217;s not my role to name the author here.<strong>]]</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><span class=\"s1\">Day Four:</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">Research discontinued for the sake of my wellbeing and the value of my time.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>The Histories of Erasing &amp; Co-Opting Indigenous Knowledge</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There is nothing new about white academics being paid to teach about Indigenous people. As Choctaw historian Devon Mihesuah writes, <span class=\"s1\">“The greatest body of acceptable telling of the Indian story is still in the hands of non-natives”.<sup><a id=\"ref2\" href=\"#fn2\">2</a> </sup> </span>While some departments may develop Indigenous content courses based on genuine desire for social justice, there are many benefits and rewards for white settlers who decide they want to teach “Indigenous content”. Suddenly, these settlers become the resident “Indigenous experts”, consultants for all things Indigenous. They are asked to sit on committees. The departments receive funding increases and accolades for their efforts. All of this, done, conveniently, without the need for <i>actual Indigenous perspectives</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Moreover, I wonder how the pursuit to integrate “Indigenous content” into all classrooms is rooted in a desire to undercut the growing strength of Indigenous Studies programs, still the home of most Indigenous faculty on campuses. For me, Indigenous Studies is a space where like-minded people can come together to learn, plan, rest, and build strength. (Which is exactly why our gatherings have always been cause for settler concern.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, the desire of Canadian universities to play a role in “reconciliation” by incorporating Indigenous content and appealing to Indigenous students is driven by corporatization and investments in extractive industry. If they give us some programming, the logic goes, perhaps we will stop complaining about their <a href=\"https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/nwmo\" target=\"_blank\">storage of nuclear waste in our communities</a>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Indigenous Philosophers are accountable to their communities</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Indigenous faculty and students are challenging the way this course is presently taught, but little has been done. The justification that forms a fortress around ignorance is “academic freedom”. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the case of perpetuating incorrect history about Indigenous peoples, understand that your academic freedom has a body count.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We heard </span>comments that this professor&#8217;s class was helpful to the cause of Indigenous Philosophy; that we should be grateful anyone was showing interest. This was followed by a suggestion that the way forward was for Indigenous professors to “work” with philosophy professors. A Nehiyaw professor objected, “Why would we spend our time teaching other people how to teach our subjects? And for free?”</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Vine Deloria, Jr. writes,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">“<i>The researcher has the luxury of studying the community as an object of science, whereas the young Indian, who knows the nuances of tribal life, receives nothing in the way of compensation or recognition for his knowledge, and instead must continue to do jobs, often manual labor, that have considerably less prestige. If knowledge of the Indian community is so valuable, how can non-Indians receive so much compensation for their small knowledge and Indians receive so little for their extensive knowledge?</i>”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">— Vine Deloria, Jr., “Research, Redskins, and Reality&#8221;<sup><a id=\"ref3\" href=\"#fn3\">3</a></sup></span></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><br />\nTo paraphrase another Indigenous faculty member, “If I walked in and decided I wanted to teach physics, they would laugh me out of the office. So why is it that this university is allowing someone to teach Indigenous content without the proper qualification?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Maintenance of White Supremacy</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To quote philosopher <a href=\"http://sgrp.typepad.com/sgrp/2015/08/how-philosophy-was-whitewashed-an-interview-with-dr-nathaniel-adam-tobias-coleman-by-aaron-salzer-of-scienceorfat-t.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Nathaniel Adam Tobias <del>Coleman</del></a>, &#8220;the effect of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natcphd/status/658202942961487872\" target=\"_blank\">#whitecurriculum</a> = we have imbued white male writers with the power &amp; authority to speak for everyone.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">It is white supremacy to believe that non-Indigenous people are automatically more capable and qualified to articulate Indigenous histories, worldviews, and stories.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">White supremacy is a white professor deciding, one day, that he’d like to teach Indigenous Philosophy. He is allowed to teach the class and given multiple platforms, including an upcoming departmental colloquium (colloquiums are mandatory for grad students).</span></p>\n<p>Now, wouldn’t it be something to invite one of the many brilliant, accomplished, world-renowned Indigenous scholars on our campus to speak to this mandatory-attendance event? (Obviously, compensation would need to be provided. It is never the responsibility of invited Indigenous scholars to share knowledge to outsiders for free.)</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Here’s the thing: even if Indigenous people were to spend our entire lives trying to explain our philosophies to settlers (this would be a great plot line for a horror movie set in Nehiyaw hell, by the way), they still might not get it.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Not only was the classroom content I described above inaccurate, but <i>silly</i>, as well, demonstrating a basic lack of understanding regarding the ways our communities operate. As Thurman Lee Hester Jr. and Dennis McPherson write in &#8220;The Euro-American Philosophical Tradition and its Ability to Examine Indigenous Philosophy&#8221;, &#8220;&#8230;to operate within the paradigm of Euro-American philosophy would mean that you are necessarily cut off from any real understanding of Indigenous thought.”<sup><a id=\"ref4\" href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is the worst accusation of all for a white male philosopher: the suggestion that he cannot know something, and further, to point out that others have knowledge he might never be able to have. Not as a result of biology (!!!), but as the result of a redefinition of <i>knowledge</i>, giving weight to embodied experience; a recognition of Indigenous epistemic privilege.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, an unwillingness to acknowledge the expertise of Indigenous intellectuals is an unwillingness to concede space, privilege, and authority.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>We are our own best wisdomkeepers</b></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"693\" data-permalink=\"http://moontimewarrior.com/2015/11/09/who-can-teach-indigenous-philosophy/ayaangwaamizin/\" data-orig-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=480\" data-orig-size=\"600,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ayaangwaamizin\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=480?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=480?w=480\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-693\" src=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"ayaangwaamizin\" srcset=\"https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=480 480w, https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=150 150w, https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg?w=300 300w, https://moontimewarrior.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ayaangwaamizin.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I want to give credit to Thurman Lee Hester Jr. and Dennis McPherson, whose work in <strong>Ayaangwaamizin</strong>:<strong> the International Journal for Indigenous Philosophy</strong> perfectly articulates why we are right to be uncomfortable if the &#8220;best person for the job&#8221; always <em>happens</em> to be a white man:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Even if workable research methodologies can be developed, there are still serious problems that make Euro-American examination of Indigenous traditions harmful.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>The most serious is the potential for a scholastic “conquest” of Indigenous philosophy. Any academic book or university class carries with it the imprimatur of authority.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>To the extent that these books are authored by Euro-Americans and these classes are taught by Euro-Americans, there is the potential for them to be perceived as the authorities on Indigenous philosophy. This tragic irony is already well underway. Many Indigenous people are reading these books and attending these classes, seeking to understand themselves and their histories.

The centering of Indigenous knowledges in universities is important, and it must be done right. <span class=\"s1\">If the foundations of the settler colonial state are not challenged, the incorporation of so-called “Indigenous content” into classrooms is a method of continuous recolonization; furthering claims of ownership and authority over Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous lands.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"> As Jeff Corntassel <a href=\"http://www.ideas-idees.ca/blog/indigenizing-academy-insurgent-education-and-roles-indigenous-intellectuals\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>, “Being a warrior of the truth is not […] about mediating between worldviews as much as challenging the dominant colonial discourse.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>It is about raising awareness of Indigenous histories and place-based existences as part of a continuing struggle against shape-shifting colonial powers.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">At the same time, respect that Indigenous students are regularly burdened with the task of “being a warrior” as we navigate through colonial institutions that force our disappearance through racist curriculum, only to hear “but we gave you Indigenous content, what more could you want from us?” </span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It’s important to remember that colonial educational institutions have never been the main method of preserving our knowledge (though we deserve to be safe in these spaces if we choose to be in them, nonetheless).</span></p>\n<p>Our ancestors were imprisoned and even killed for practicing our knowledges, and yet, they persist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This summer, I heard stories of how the land overlooking kisiskâciwani-sîpiy, where the University of Saskatchewan currently stands, was a gathering place for centuries.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Strange, then, how much it upsets folks when we burn sage and sweetgrass in offices and classrooms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I heard stories from elders of how Métis and Nehiyaw mothers would construct improvised sweat lodge ceremonies using rocks heated in a frying pan, with blankets thrown over tables.

As much of the world reels, there&#8217;s something very brutal about the idea that now is a good time to demand that others listen to your very clever opinion. If it&#8217;s barbarism to write poetry after Auschwitz, then it&#8217;s also barbarism to write thinkpieces after Paris. <em>Don&#8217;t politicise</em>; don&#8217;t use mass murder to score rhetorical points against your enemies, don&#8217;t crow <em>je te l&#8217;avais bien dit</em>, don&#8217;t play tug-of-war with the bodies, don&#8217;t make this about yourself, <em>don&#8217;t make this about politics</em>.</p>\n<p>Which on the face of it is odd: death is always political, and nothing is more political than a terrorist attack. These events happen for political reasons, and they have political consequences; to have an opinion is nice if frustrating in times of peace, but absolutely essential in times of crisis. And yet. A sense of disgust rises when people comment on France&#8217;s unprecedented measure of closing its borders by bleating that if they&#8217;d done that earlier, all this could have been avoided; when they start gurgling about the global threat of Islam and the foreigners in our midst; when they smugly declare that restrictive gun laws left the population defenceless. This isn&#8217;t a tendency limited to the political right: there are plenty on the <em>soi-disant</em> left also using the massacre as a pristine stage on which to exhibit their one-person morality plays. What if the attackers had been white; wouldn&#8217;t we all be talking about mental health? Don&#8217;t you know that non-Muslims commit atrocities too? Why do you care about <em>this</em>, and not about all the other tragedies going on elsewhere in the world? Can&#8217;t you see that all these bodies only exist to prove that I was right about everything all along?</p>\n<p>Normally the duty to not opine would only apply to a very small sector of the population, but for the last few years we&#8217;ve all been at it. Most of this take-mongering is happening online, and it feels absolutely and entirely <em>wrong</em> to be worthily prognosticating about hundreds of personal apocalypses on the same platforms and in the same forms that are used to sound off about TV shows and and football matches. A lot of this has to do with the demands of the format itself: you&#8217;re endlessly encouraged to Have Your Say and Join The Conversation, to constantly be filling white boxes with words, because what you think about any given topic is now incredibly important, and before you know it, in the stampede to have your say and join the conversation you&#8217;re trampling over the dead. We scrawl our thoughts in blood. To express anything other than sorrow is monstrous.</p>\n<p>But then look at what&#8217;s being said. Last night, President Hollande stood outside the Bataclan concert hall, where many dozens had died, to say that &#8216;we are going to fight, and this fight will be merciless.&#8217; There will be more war, more death, and more tragedy. The TV stations are bringing in experts to insist that this is all the fault of the migrants and the foreigners, as if refugees were carrying the violence they fled along with them. More repression, more cruelty, more pogroms. Terrorist attacks, as we all know, are carried out with the intent of setting the people against each other and sparking an intensification of the violence of the State, and so the people are duly set against each other, and the State announces its determination to do violence. This is already a politicisation of the tragedy, and to loudly speak out against it is yet another: is that also unacceptable? The day before the attacks in Paris, two suicide bombers blew themselves up in <span class=\"st\">Bourj el-Barajneh</span>, a predominately Shia suburb of Beirut, murdering 43 innocent people as they went about their lives. Wire agencies such as Reuters reported an attack against a &#8216;Hezbollah stronghold.&#8217; The humanity of the victims disappeared, they were brutally synecdochised into a political party that some of them may or may not have supported, they weren&#8217;t people, they were Hezbollah, as if what had been attacked were a castle sharp with battlements rather than a neighbourhood full of families. Many people very loudly voiced their horror at this &#8211; but that was also the politicisation of tragedy: was that also unacceptable?</p>\n<p>When it&#8217;s deployed honestly, the command to not politicise means to not make someone&#8217;s death about <em>something else</em>: it&#8217;s not about the issue you&#8217;ve always cared about; it&#8217;s not about <em>you</em>. To do this is one type of politics. But there&#8217;s another. Insisting on the humanity of the victims is also a political act, and as tragedy is spun into civilisational conflict or an excuse to victimise those who are already victims, it&#8217;s a very necessary one. There is the politicisation that seizes on death for limited political aims, and then there is the politicisation that would refuse any predetermined script other than the call for liberation. It insists on the political nature of tragedy, not to shunt it towards one or another narrative pit, or to put a left-ish or right-ish filter over the images of bloodshed, but because politics is a way out of all this. Atrocity demands solidarity. Absolute sympathy for the victims; for <em>all</em> victims. To insist on having an opinion, not the knowing sneer of someone who was right all along, but undiminished solidarity in the face of devastation. To fight against those who attack concerts and cafes, those who bomb cities with fighter jets and with their own bodies, those who abandon migrants to the cold outside their borders, and those sent them fleeing. To struggle: the common struggle of all who suffer, against suffering.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><em>This post was updated as further information about the attacks became available. </em></p>\n<p>The death toll in what is shaping up to be the deadliest terrorist attack in French history spiked late Friday after police stormed the Bataclan concert hall in Paris where at least two gunmen had been holding scores of hostages and found that at least 100 of them had been killed by the attackers. The grim tally caused French authorities to raise the estimated death toll to 127, with another 200 wounded.</p>\n<p>The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attacks.</p>\n<p>The public prosecutor for Paris, François Molins, told reporters the terrorists hit six sites: Stade de France, where an unknown number of people died; Rue de Charonne, where as many as 18 were killed; Rue Alibert, where up to 14 were murdered; Boulevard Voltaire, where one died; Rue Fontaine le Roi, where five died; and the Bataclan concert hall, where at least 80 were killed by several attackers.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the Bataclan, which saw the worst of the carnage, French President François Hollande struck a defiant tone, saying, &#8220;We are going to lead a war; it will be pitiless,&#8221; in tracking down and eliminating those connected with the attacks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When terrorists are capable of committing such atrocities, they must be certain that they are facing a determined France, a united France, a France that is together and does not let itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow,&#8221; he said. French authorities have said that the attackers at the Bataclan blew themselves up with suicide belts when the police closed in on them.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"480\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SHOCKING: The explosions can be heard inside the stadium!

We will never break. That’s the character of our two nations&#8230;. Such savagery can never threaten who we are. We will respond. We will overcome. We will endure.”</p>\n<p>The attacks will likely embolden those in Europe and the United States who have warned against allowing migrants from the Middle East and North Africa into their societies. Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepJeffDuncan/status/665326737924976641\">tweeted</a>: “How&#8217;s that Syrian refugee resettlement look now? How about that mass migration into Europe? Terrorism is alive &amp; well in the world. #No.”</p>\n<p>There is no indication that the migration crisis from the Middle East currently roiling Europe had anything to do with Friday’s attacks, but more than 1,000 French citizens are <a href=\"http://icsr.info/2015/01/foreign-fighter-total-syriairaq-now-exceeds-20000-surpasses-afghanistan-conflict-1980s/\">thought</a> to have traveled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State in recent years, and about 250 have since returned, according to estimates from French authorities. Across the continent, at least 6,000 Europeans have joined the jihadi group.</p>\n<p>Eyewitnesses at the Bataclan theater have reported that at least one of the attackers spoke French.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This is the first successful terrorist attack in Paris since a three-day ordeal last January when gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi stormed satirical newspaper </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Charlie Hebdo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">’s offices, killing 12. Two days later, gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed four after storming a kosher grocery store in Paris. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The Kouachi brothers, who were later shot dead by police, had pledged allegiance to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Coulibaly, who was also shot and killed by police, claimed he coordinated with them but pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Friday evening’s attacks, which appear to be coordinated, come soon after French authorities claimed they thwarted a separate attack at a naval base in the country’s south. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The naval base was home to the Charles de Gaulle, the aircraft carrier that has been deployed to the Persian Gulf to support France’s bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It also comes amid new evidence suggesting that militants tied to the Islamic State &#8212; once thought to be focused mainly on controlling their self-declared caliphate &#8212; were now crossing into other countries to carry out terrorist strikes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">U.S. authorities believe the Islamic State was responsible for the downing of a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people onboard. Spanish authorities said earlier this month that they successfully dismantled an Islamic State cell that was plotting an attack in Madrid.

The result is a perfect way to indulge on a Sunday afternoon that lacks blue skies and sun; the apples aren&#8217;t sweetened too much because the marzipan is already very sweet, you can taste the cardamom but it&#8217;s not overpowering, and all this served warm&#8230; *sigh*</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is definitely something I&#8217;ll be making again, maybe with juicy red plums as they also go really well with cardamom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">By the way, one of these pies actually feeds two &#8211; so go and share!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"9373\" data-permalink=\"https://dinnerfornone.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,907\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D300&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1445776617&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Apple Marzipan Walnut Pies 04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=480\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9373\" src=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=480&#038;h=318\" alt=\"Apple Marzipan Walnut Pies 04\" srcset=\"https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=480&amp;h=318 480w, https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=958&amp;h=636 958w, https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199 300w, https://dinnerfornone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/apple-marzipan-walnut-pies-04.jpg?w=768&amp;h=510 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><div class=\"hrecipe jetpack-recipe\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Recipe\"><h3 class=\"jetpack-recipe-title\" itemprop=\"name\">Apple, Marzipan &amp; Walnut Pies</h3><ul class=\"jetpack-recipe-meta\"><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-servings\" itemprop=\"recipeYield\"><strong>Servings: </strong>2</li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-time\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<time itemprop=\"totalTime\" datetime=\"prep 15 mins / baking 20 mins\"><strong>Time: </strong>prep 15 mins / baking 20 mins</time>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li><li class=\"jetpack-recipe-print\"><a href=\"#\">Print</a></li></ul><div class=\"jetpack-recipe-content\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">1 roll puff pastry<br />\n2 pie dishes (18 x 13.5 cm / 7 x 5 1/4″)<br />\nbutter for greasing</p>\n<p>1.5 &#8211; 2 cooking apples, cored, peeled and grated into sticks<br />\n50 g marzipan, chopped<br />\n1 handful walnuts, chopped<br />\n1 pinch (1 ml) cardamom powder<br />\n2 &#8211; 3 tbsp raw cane sugar</p>\n<p>1 egg, whisked<br />\nhandful of coarse sugar for decorating</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Grease pie dishes with butter.

      "content": "<p>This week we have witnessed a phenomenal act of social movement-making in an era when many, myself included, have wondered if meaningful change in the U.S. still possible.</p>\n<p>Some of that worry is about aging, I’m sure. As you get older and the people around you get older you are inclined to wonder if the kids can ever be as alright as the kids you were.</p>\n<p>We overstate our youthful courageousness. Then, because we are wily from age, we defend that overstatement by understating the courage of the youth who displace us. That may be natural. But when a cross-campus coalition of student-athletes and student-citizens at the University of Missouri organized to force the retirement of the college president (and future “transition” of the university system chancellor) they did something remarkable.</p>\n<p>These young people took on the growing, well-paid, powerful administrative class in corporate higher education and actually won a concession.</p>\n<p>We can debate whether the concessions these students won are material enough for the hard-core Marxists, too symbolic for the crusty pragmatists, or replicable enough for the devout organizers. But we who believe in democracy as verb instead of noun should relish the moment.</p>\n<p>We should also defend the moment against the inevitable media contortions.</p>\n<p>Almost immediately the Mizzou student actions became a battleground over the first amendment, media and fascism when at a rally some protestors formed a human shield to block a photographer from campus media from recording the protestors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Granted, my social media feed is heavily weighted towards media folks but you would have thought this moment was Tienneman Square for the media caterwauling. More than a handful of editors, reporters, and mainstream media organizations condemned the Mizzou students as spoiled, anti-democratic, ridiculous, and enemies to their own cause.</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>David Simon, a writer who was once a journalist, went further.</p>\n<p>He told <a href=\"http://nymag.com/following/2015/11/david-simon-roxane-gay-tressie-cottom-debate-missouri-protests.html\">me</a> (and Roxane Gay, a brilliant writer who can speak for herself) over an hours-long diatribe on Twitter that the Mizzou students were fascists in “intent”, the photographer was the real hero of recent events, and that these were the moments on the slippery slope to the decline of American democracy.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_4346\" style=\"width: 225px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"4346\" data-permalink=\"https://tressiemc.wordpress.com/2015/11/12/fascism/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png\" data-orig-size=\"317,442\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Fascism Means Something\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png?w=215&#038;h=300\" data-large-file=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png?w=317\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4346\" src=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png?w=215&#038;h=300\" alt=\"Fascism means something.\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png?w=215&amp;h=300 215w, https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png?w=108&amp;h=150 108w, https://tressiemc.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/screen-shot-2015-11-11-at-9-14-21-pm1.png 317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 215px) 100vw, 215px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fascism means something.</p></div>\n<p>He also intimated that I lack intellectual rigor to engage with him about fascism or anything really.</p>\n<p>I’ll respect his right to be protected from my undisciplined intellectual inquiry.</p>\n<p>I want David Simon to have a safe space.</p>\n<p>The rest of you aren’t so lucky.</p>\n<p>First, let me put as fine a point on my position as possible.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The press is not a rational objective actor.</p>\n<p>The press shapes as much as it documents.</p>\n<p>All press benefits as much from social change as it benefits from the status quo. That means the press, especially corporate media, is always serving two masters.</p>\n<p>The press has rights but so do persons and sometimes we define those rights by working through the moments when they clash.</p>\n<p>This is a heavy moment for those clashes. The moment’s heaviness deserves attention because context matters to intellectual rigor, if not hyperbolic hand-waving.</p>\n<h5></h5>\n<h5>The Moment For Movement-Making</h5>\n<p>The Mizzou student-activists are organizing in a moment of public, private and <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/nsa-surveillance\">State surveillance</a> unlike any ever before seen in modern history in a wealthy imperialist nation where a huge part of our conspicuous consumption is surveilling ourselves as a status symbol.</p>\n<p>They are organizing within the most corporate driven era of higher education in the history of the United States with all that entails for curtailing citizen-building at the expense of making markets and more consumers.</p>\n<p>These students were organizing against the major capital interests that can now purchase unprecedented access to politicians in a massive police apparatus that has virtually unchecked privilege to target, surveill, detain and murder in a media culture controlled by many of the same capital interests.</p>\n<p>This moment requires a level of sophistication that I doubt even my elder cohort can quite grasp. This is not the 1960s. It isn’t even the 1980s.</p>\n<p>Social media allowed Mizzou students to attract the requisite public attention for successful social action. But, media both social and traditional (and increasingly that’s a false distinction but it still means something discursively so roll with it) can bring as much harm as it can good given the political economy in which we all live.</p>\n<p>The first amendment protects the press against censure but it does not delimit the democratic action of those the press covers.</p>\n<p>All due respect to the man who gave the world Stringer Bell but what we saw at that student rally was democracy in action, not fascism.</p>\n<p>Fascism means something more than a thing one does not like.</p>\n<p>Fascism means a system of social organization that concentrates power and doesn’t just discourage dissent but organizes the State against it.</p>\n<p>I don’t like to literalize metaphors for the most part. I like creative license. I use it from time to time with various degrees of success. Denying writers metaphors is cheap way to become a demagogue.</p>\n<p>But sometimes the material reality subsumes creative licence and the moment at Missouri is one such moment.</p>\n<p>It’s not just that the moment is important. It&#8217;s not just that the students are still very much in danger for doing something important. It is that hand-waving about a fascist state can confuse us about what making democracy looks like.</p>\n<hr />\n<h5>Democracy Is Messy</h5>\n<p>Historical narratives about Great Men can be a trap.</p>\n<p>These narratives are important but they also have the benefit of hindsight. They can make events seem pre-determined. The actors in them appear uniquely gifted to bring about social change. Resistors always seem weak because we know from the outset that they lose.</p>\n<p>These stories, which we love, can lull us into thinking that social change is polite when historically and presently it is anything but. Still, we clamor for polite protests that follow imaginary rulebooks for Democracy 101.</p>\n<p>The complaints from well-meaning people around Ferguson were about the same as those around the March on Washington as those around Reconstruction.</p>\n<p>Very few people want to be <em>actual</em> fascists or actual racists but they don’t want to be late for work or awakened by sirens either. So, people say in various ways, could protestors stay off of residential streets after 7 PM and during rush hour traffic and also not make the buses in Birmingham late or unprofitable because people rely on those jobs and maybe too if the students at Mizzou could just write a nice letter and be grateful for their scholarships.</p>\n<p>Mizzou students may have seen that historical narrative because they resisted its traps. It’s the trap that leads the media to cover those well-meaning people in Ferguson like they covered them in Birmingham like they covered them throughout Reconstruction – as well-meaning harmless folks who just believe in rules.</p>\n<h5>The Media Is Complicit And Mizzou Students Knew It</h5>\n<p>The media rarely calls people racists.</p>\n<p>Even when people&#8217;s fetish for rules over justice makes them complicit in extra-judicial murder of black men, women and children.</p>\n<p>Even when these well-meaning harmless folks only want the “rules” of biological superiority of whiteness to prevail in policy-making and bell curves about the scientific inferiority of brown people to justify resource provisions for everything from schools to prisons the media rarely calls this racism.</p>\n<p>Sociologist Bonilla-Silva talks about <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Racism-without-Racists-Color-Blind-Persistence/dp/1442220554\">a U.S. culture where there is miraculously racism but no racists.</a> He interviews people, across race and class, and finds that they can talk about aspects of racism but have a multitude of narratives that makes no one complicit really.</p>\n<p>And the media – at least the mainstream media – by and large follows suit.</p>\n<p>I’ve asked some of those same people on my media-heavy social media before if their outlets have style guides about when they will or will not use “racism” or “racist” in reporting.</p>\n<p>The gist seems to be that the media relies on the “objective” rationality of its reporters to make that call. Perhaps in a diverse media industry this would lead to sparkling debates about what constitutes racism when publishing. In that alternate universe one might expect to see &#8220;racism&#8221; show-up as much as it&#8217;s many euphemisms (&#8220;racial issues&#8221; etc.).</p>\n<h5>The &#8220;No-Racists&#8221; Feedback Loop</h5>\n<p>Of course, media outlets don’t reflect the U.S. population as much as they reflect the demographic make-up of the nation’s power elite.</p>\n<p>Just thirteen percent of newsroom employers are “minorities” defined <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/04/in-the-news-industry-diversity-is-lowest-at-smaller-outlets/\">here</a> as broadly as possible to include anyone non-white basically. The figures are smaller when you break that category up by race. The numbers are slightly higher in television news at 22 percent but again that’s for every non-white category.</p>\n<p>One way to look at an important axis of power in how news is shaped by the taken-for-granted editorial norms is to consider the diversity among media shot-callers. The Pew Research Center finds that with news directors you approach racial parity in a handful of large media markets but only 13 percent for the rest of the many newsrooms across the country. Again, newspapers are worse than television with just ten percent of those supervisors being a “minority”.</p>\n<p>Digital media was supposed to blow this wide open. Greater access might fix that pipeline problem of minority journalism grads not finding that all-important first media job. So far, the National Association of Black Journalists are <a href=\"http://www.nabj.org/news/164828/NABJ-An-Open-Letter-to-News-Media-Startups.htm\">unimpressed</a> with the reality: digital newsrooms do not seem to be building better pipelines than traditional media.</p>\n<p>This only matters, of course, if you think diverse persons is in any way related to diversity of ideas. I’ll concede that’s debatable even as I admit that I think, with some margin of error, it’s the most efficient first step.</p>\n<p>As it stands, most media people come from the same socio-economic background. They share a racial identity (white). And, they are often produced by closed of social networks and elite institutions. It is no wonder that they tend to share ideas about when something does or does not earn the label “racism”.</p>\n<p>As one reporter told me, they rely on other people – their subjects – to call something racist. Given the research that shows that people also rarely call anything racist, even when acknowledging racism, we end up in a divine feedback loop: people see racism but no racists and media will only report on what people say is racist.</p>\n<p>The feedback loop can feel like a noose when you are organizing against the very racism people might agree exists but that no one will name.</p>\n<p>How do you describe why someone would draw a swastika in feces on a college wall if we preclude the discussion of racism as an act with actors?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>How can you organize around acts of racism to do the work that well-meaning folk don’t do when we can call something fascist but can’t call anything racist?</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That’s the media climate the Missouri students were navigating. They chose to do what social movement organizations almost always do: They tried to control their message.</p>\n<p>Mizzou student organizers used social media because it allows some of that control, granting access to media organizations on their terms and sometimes denying it altogether.</p>\n<p>They did this knowing that sensationalist headlines are used to generate revenue and sometimes the <a href=\"http://niemanreports.org/articles/automation-in-the-newsroom/\" target=\"_blank\">algorithmically driven choices</a> can malign as much as they can report.</p>\n<p>They did this knowing that the media may not have a great record with labeling racism as such but it does have a record of <a href=\"http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1495&amp;context=lcp\" target=\"_blank\">using the mugshots of black criminal defendants at higher rates than do those of white criminal defendants</a>.</p>\n<p>They did this in a media culture that can be the disinfectant but that has also historically been the infection. Given this, the rhetoric got heated.</p>\n<p>But, we saw the video of the student photographer at the Missouri rally. Somehow ideas circulated. They may not have circulated for profit, but they circulated. And the police weren&#8217;t marshaled to remove the photographer, as would happen in a fascist state.</p>\n<p>As a result of all of this, many of us now know a bit more about the machinery of modern organizing in our culture.</p>\n<p>That’s how the democratic sausage is made and this week it was made by a group of young people whose safety, well-being and accomplishments trump creative license and metaphor.</p>\n",

You’ll probably start with a handful of subatomic particles, a sprinkling of energy, and give it all a good mix together. If, as is more likely, you are a writer trying to build a new universe on your typewriter your building blocks are going to be different. To create a new <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, or the desert planet of <em>Arrakis</em>, or the island of <a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com/grrm_book/a-game-of-thrones-5-book-bundle/\">Westeros</a>, you’re going to need new <em>words</em> – and more than just a few of them…</p>\n<p>2015 is quite a year for science fiction fans. This December will see the release of the <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens\">seventh chapter</a> in the <em>Star Wars</em> series, <em>The Force Awakens</em>, one of the most eagerly anticipated films of all time – and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/02/star-wars-epidode-vii-box-office-film\">potentially the most lucrative</a>. 2015 also marks the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <em>Dune</em>, <a href=\"http://www.dunenovels.com/author/frank-herbert\">Frank Herbert</a>’s science fiction <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/30/frank-herbert-dune-at-50-sci-fi-masterpiece\">masterpiece</a>. Set millennia into our own “future”, <a href=\"http://www.dunenovels.com/novel/dune\">Dune</a> tells the tale of a young nobleman who enlists the powers of a strange desert people to avenge the death of his father.</p>\n<p>Arguably, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/george-lucas-9388168\">George Lucas</a>’ Star Wars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/03/dune-50-years-on-science-fiction-novel-world\">borrows more than just a desert setting</a> from Herbert’s 1960s classic. One thing that the two sagas certainly have in common is an abundance of fantastic and exotic words. From Herbert, for example, we have “Paul Atreides”, “Vladimir Harkonnen”, “stillsuits” and “sandworms”. From Lucas and his colleagues, we have “Luke Skywalker”, “Darth Vader”, “lightsabers” and “ewoks”.</p>\n<p>But just how did Frank Herbert and George Lucas come up with these wonderful new words?</p>\n<p>Lucas and Herbert – just like<a href=\"http://www.georgerrmartin.com/\"> George R. R Martin</a> – might not be <a href=\"https://languagejazz.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/a-game-of-tongues-why-george-r-r-martin-is-a-linguist-after-all/\">trained linguists</a>. But, in naming the alien things and novel concepts that populate their fantasy worlds, they both demonstrate high levels of sophistication in <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199689880.do\"><strong>lexicogenesis</strong></a> – the term linguist <a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/gary-miller\">Gary Miller</a> uses to describe the processes which give rise to new words. And, as it turns out, they rely on the very same processes of word creation that linguists have identified on our own planet – the very same mechanisms that all of us can use, and which keep English topped up with everyday <strong>neologisms</strong> like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34723515\">“manspreading”, “contactless” and “binge-watch”</a>.</p>\n<p>So, in celebration of a bumper year for science fiction, here are the ten main ways that budding science fiction writers, like Frank Herbert and George Lucas, can create new words for new worlds.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Borrow words (and the concepts they represent)</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, new fantasy worlds need to have some commonalities with our own universe or otherwise we’d struggle to connect with them on any sort of level. It’s no surprise that both Dune and Star Wars feature humans (or humanoids at least) – as well as planets, stars, deserts, food, drink, gravity, love, hate, and so on. It’s trivial to say that, for most of these, there’s no need for a new word. It suffices to use the relevant linguistic label (the <strong>common noun</strong>), like “planet” or “star”, that already exists in English – or whatever language the writer is working in.</p>\n<p>But where the word and concept doesn’t exist in English, there’s also the possibility of <strong>borrowing</strong> common nouns, and the relevant <strong>concepts</strong> they represent, from other languages too. Herbert does this masterfully in Dune, borrowing heavily from Arabic (“Butlerian jihad”, “erg”, “Mahdi”) and Persian, as well as Turkish, Latin and French. In Dune, the title for the ruler of the galaxy (the “Padishah” Emperor), for example, comes directly from Persian.</p>\n<p>In borrowing these words and concepts, Herbert gives us a flavour of “<a href=\"http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Galach\">Galach</a>”, the “<em>official language of the Imperium</em>” and the native tongue of Dune’s central characters. In the same way that the English of North America mixes British English together with words and concepts from Spanish, French, and various indigenous languages, Herbert’s fictional language is “<em>hybrid Inglo-Slavic with strong traces of cultural-specialisation terms adopted during the long chain of human migration</em>”. Lucas too, is not afraid of a bit of borrowing either. The word “stormtrooper” (the English translation of “Stosstrupp”), for example, comes from Nazi Germany.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Borrow proper names</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In any science fiction universe, people and places need naming too. <strong>Proper names</strong> can be taken from a variety of source languages, and not just English. Herbert, for example, borrows many first names and family names directly from English (“Jessica”, “Duncan”) as well as Russian (“Vladimir”), Finnish (“Harkonnen”), Chinese (“Yueh”), and ancient Greek (“Leto”). Lucas also derives characters’ names from a variety of sources, including a Moghul emperor (“Admiral Ackbar”) and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ssx_-JH-eA\">1960s TV character</a> (“Han Solo”). Despite the linguistic diversity, however, it’s perhaps not surprising that the central characters of both Dune and Star Wars still have first names (“Paul” and “Luke”) that are less than alien to English speakers.</p>\n<p>Proper names can also be borrowed to name other things too, such as places. Dune’s “Giedi Prime”, for example, is derived from the name of a star in the <a href=\"http://www.constellation-guide.com/constellation-list/capricornus-constellation/\">Capricornus Constellation</a>. Luke Skywalker’s home planet “Tatooine” takes its name from a city in Tunisia.</p>\n<p>And, as is the case on our own planet, you can use place names as surnames (Dune’s “Duncan Idaho” or Star Wars’ “Wedge Antilles”), or surnames as first names (“Anakin”, for example, comes from the surname of a British film director). And, likewise, if you want to give familiar names and labels just a whiff of the exotic, you can use an unusual spelling but keep the sound or pronunciation the same. One of Herbert’s minor characters, for example, is called “Piter”. This is something that George R. R. Martin does to even greater effect in <em>A Game of Thrones</em> (think “Robb Stark”, “Jaime Lannister”, “Joffrey” and “Ser Jorah”).</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Use existing words for completely unrelated concepts and things</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Related to the first two, you can also take existing linguistic labels, from English or otherwise, and apply them to new – seemingly unrelated – concepts or things. In Star Wars, the proper names of characters “Wedge” and “Wicket” are everyday common nouns (the latter being everyday, at least, if you are a fan of cricket). In Dune, Arrakis’ all important spice “melange” borrows its label from the French for “mixture”. The drug “verite”, for example, looks like the French word for “truth”.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Extend the meaning of existing words</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In fantasy fiction, it’s not always clear whether there is supposed to be a <strong>semantic</strong> link, metaphorical or otherwise, between the linguistic label from our own planet and the concept, person or thing it is used to represent – even if you can’t stop yourself as a reader from mentally trying to find one. For example, it’s not clear whether the Dune spice is supposed to be a mixture of various substances, or whether “verite” – a bit like ten pints of lager – is more likely to make you tell the truth.</p>\n<p>However, what is certain is that another very good way of naming new concepts and things is to simply take an existing word, and extend its meaning. Herbert, for example, uses this process of semantic <strong>extension</strong> to come up the word “shield” (some kind of electromagnetic defensive barrier) and “carryall” (a flying vehicle for transporting spice). Famously, Lucas extends the common meaning of “force” to describe the invisible “<em>energy field created by all living things</em>” that gives a Jedi their power.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Extend the function of existing words</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Related to this, another way to create new words is the process of <strong>conversion</strong> – that is, taking an existing word and changing its grammatical function. <strong>Verbing</strong>, the process of creating a verb from another part of speech, is a very common example of conversion in English (think “to email” and “to text”). Herbert does it, for example, with “weirding room”, creating a verb from the adjective “weird”.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Play with a word’s component sounds</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>One simple mechanism for creating new words is to take old ones and make small changes to their pronunciation. For example, one of the major cities on Herbert’s Dune planet is “Carthag”, which can be arrived at by changing a <strong>phoneme</strong> (vowel or consonant) or two of “Carthage” (“Qartaj” in Arabic) – the ancient Tunisian city. Apparently, for Star Wars, Lucas derived the name “Chewbacca” from “sobaka” the Russian word for dog. Interestingly, these sorts of <strong>phonological</strong> changes often mirror the changes that happen to words on our planet, as languages <strong>evolve</strong>, or as they are borrowed from one language into another.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Build new words from parts of old ones</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In any language – certainly in any Earth language – words are built up from smaller chunks of meaning, called <strong>morphemes</strong> (themselves built up from phonemes). As a result, new words can be formed by chopping bits off existing words, or by adding adding other bits to them.</p>\n<p>In Dune, for example, Herbert creates a name for the galaxy’s currency “Solari” by taking the word “solar” and adding “-i”, which looks suspiciously like the Arabic <strong>suffix</strong> used to describe people from a particular region (think “Iraqi” or “Pakistani”). He also derives the name of the prevalent language, “Galach”, by chopping the end of the word “galaxy”, in a process which linguists call <a href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/back-formation\"><strong>back-formation</strong></a>. Similarly in Star Wars, to create the gangster “Greedo”, Lucas takes an adjective befitting the character’s penchant for money and adds the suffix “-o”, an English device for creating faux Italian or Spanish names (like “el stinko”).</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> Combine words in new ways</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Perhaps the most common – and most <a href=\"https://languagejazz.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/combinations-at-the-heart-of-linguistic-creativity/\">fundamental</a> – way of creating new words is to simply combine old ones together. Both Herbert and Lucas rely heavily on <a href=\"https://languagejazz.wordpress.com/2014/03/30/dawn-hearts-and-jellyspoons-creativity-and-the-compound-noun-3/\"><strong>compound nouns</strong></a>, which forge together two or more words – and the concepts which underpin them – to create entirely new ones. In Dune, for example, there are “stillsuits”, “groundcars”, “sandworms” and “battle language”. In Star Wars, famously, there are “star destroyers”, “lightsabers” and “the Death Star”.</p>\n<p>On Earth as on more distant planets, wherever compound nouns get too long, especially when describing machines or organisations, it’s not uncommon to substitute them for a suitable acronym. On Arrakis, for example, the “Field CP” is a “command post”. In Star Wars, “ATAT” is an “All Terrain Armoured Transport”.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong> Use any combination of the above</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, if you want to be really creative, you can use pretty much any combination of the processes above. Herbert, in particular, isn’t afraid to mix and match. He forms “lasgun” and “repkit”, for example, by contracting the compounds “laser gun” and “repair kit” to form what linguists call <strong>portmanteau</strong> words or <strong>blends</strong>. “CHOAM”, a powerful intra-galactic trading company, stands for “Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles”, where “Honnete” and “Ober” are borrowed from French and Old German, respectively.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong> Create a new word from scratch</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, if all else fails, you can simply create a new word from scratch – that is, from some arbitrary combination of vowels and consonants. When you do so, you need to make a decision whether the new word you create will fit into the <strong>sound system</strong> <strong>of English</strong> – that is, the set of rules which govern which phonemes, and which combination of phonemes, are allowed in English – or whether it will fit into some other, possibly alien, language. For example, while “Han” and “Hoth” are entirely plausible words in English, “pchagavas” and “hrobas” in Herbert’s invented “Chakobsa” language, are definitely not.</p>\n<p>It’s actually pretty difficult to invent a new word that doesn’t share <a href=\"http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/jabber/jabberwocky.html\">at least some similarities with existing ones</a>. But short of asking Frank Herbert or George Lucas directly, it’s really quite difficult to tell if a word is an entirely arbitrary invention, or whether similarities with other words are intended for artistic reasons. For example, is Paul Atreides’ home planet of “Caladan” a complete invention, or is it derived somehow from (the equally watery) “Caledonia”? Is the name for Dune’s native “Fremen” an accidental string of vowels and consonants, or is it a contraction of “Free men”? Because we all love looking for deeper, hidden meanings in words, the fantasy universes of Dune and Star Wars leave plenty of room for <strong>folk etymologies</strong> about the meaning of things. According to <a href=\"http://www.starwarsselect.com/wordorigins.html\">this</a> website, for example, Han Solo’s name means “he who is alone”:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>“Solo” means alone, and Han is very much a loner. Also in Swedish, Han means “he”. Combine these two definitions, and the resulting translation is “he [who is] alone.” </em></p>\n<p>Whether that’s what Lucas had in mind is highly debatable, and the man himself has been known to spread <a href=\"http://www.inafarawaygalaxy.com/2014/03/darth-vader-name-meaning-dark-father.html\">a few myths</a> about how his characters’ names were created.</p>\n",

I assume.</p>\n<p>Most days I find myself alone in my room, lights off; silence deafening yet somehow comforting. I let myself drown in the black hole I created for myself.</p>\n<p>Most times I think about why a man plays many roles.</p>\n<p>Most times I think about how many friends do I really have – if social media is an indicator &#8212; then how many of them have I shared (real) experiences with.</p>\n<p>I see pigments of myself from the people I meet. May it be the way the Vietnamese lady happily rides her bike, or the way the vendor carefully arranges my order. Maybe i wished to be that person I just took a photo of. The way I see and define others becomes an extension of self, the ghost of my other selves.</p>\n<p><a

Three of the children wear t-shirts saying &#8220;Future Soldier&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The poppy was once a symbol to remind us of the senseless massacre of millions upon millions of people in muddy fields far away from home. The poppy was supposed to say <em>never again </em>to the horrors of a spat between politicians murdering a generation. What it is now is a symbol of militarism, and standard used to recruit children to don a uniform and go off and get themselves killed. It means the opposite of what it is supposed to.</p>\n<p>I admit I&#8217;d stopped wearing the red poppy about six or seven years ago. I am not sure if it was because my eyes opened to what it symbolises these days, or whether it was because the poppy itself had become twisted into a mark of jingoism. The trend certainly seems to have grown stronger in recent years.</p>\n<p>Policing of wearing the poppy has grown absurd: public figures face attacks, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/james-mcclean-reveals-wont-wear-6740133\">all the way up to death threats</a>, for not wearing one. There are fucking poppies all over everything, from buses, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adventuresofrob/status/661153469869461504\">to a big fuckoff wearable poppy costume</a>. GCHQ are taking a break from peeking at our internets and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-gloucestershire-29745303\">turning themselves into a humongous poppy</a>, and looking a lot like budget Doctor Who villains in the process.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, opinion pieces glorifying the deaths in the First World War seem to be on the rise, with pundits and politicians alike acting as though it was anything other than a meaningless mass killing that fucked up the world for generations.</p>\n<p>And now it all becomes clearer than ever. They want us to forget what happened and pretend&#8211;as they did a hundred years ago&#8211;as though wars are nothing more than a jolly good lark. They brainwash children: not to mourn, but to strive to emulate. I cannot stop looking at that picture. It makes my gorge rise. These are children, and yet in a few years&#8217; time, if they follow the naive dream they are being steered towards, we could be seeing them shipped back in coffins.</p>\n<p>Instead of the symbols, the reminders, we should focus on <em>actually remembering. </em>On remembering, one sees the brutal senselessness of this slaughter. With a symbol, it is all too easy to simply radicalise children into militarism.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really know how to finish them, so we&#8217;ll end with Wilfred Owen, who saw this coming almost a century ago.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace<br />\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,<br />\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,<br />\nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;<br />\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood<br />\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,<br />\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud<br />\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—<br />\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest<br />\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,<br />\nThe old Lie: <em>Dulce et decorum est</em><br />\n<em>Pro patria mori.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>If there&#8217;s an afterlife, I imagine Owen is very, very angry right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://veteransforpeace.org.uk/2015/my-name-is-legion/\">MY NAME IS LEGION – The British Legion and the Control of Remembrance</a> (Ron Tweedy)- An in-depth look at remembrance and the RBL, covering similar themes to this post, but far more extensively.</p>\n<p><em>__</em></p>\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><em>Enjoyed what you read?

It came to my attention again recently when it was being discussed on a baby forum, and was roundly praised for its raw honesty.

I like it when they have a full set of teeth. When they can pout and whine and needle and wheedle and otherwise articulate what is wrong if something is bugging them. When they want you to play pretend games with imaginary monsters called “Peeny Pony Pins Bons Boons”. When they can pick their nose and wipe it on you, sing songs about their penis and laugh at their own farts during storytime at the library.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"9001\" data-permalink=\"http://hugzillablog.com/2015/10/26/a-love-letter-to-the-baby-i-thought-i-hated/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png\" data-orig-size=\"794,554\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.23.00 pm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=480\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9001 size-large\" src=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=480&#038;h=335\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.23.00 pm\" srcset=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=480&amp;h=335 480w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=209 300w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png?w=768&amp;h=536 768w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-00-pm.png 794w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a></p>\n<p>My one year old has been a “difficult” baby. I say this because he has been much harder work than my three year old ever was, and he was never much like a trip to Disneyland. My first born never slept much during the day, never stopped moving and demanded my attention all the time: but he was mostly happy. Now at three, nothing much has changed.</p>\n<p>My second born son is the kind of kid who would have been an only child if he had just been slightly higher in the birth order.</p>\n<p>He had to be induced at ten days overdue and made it very clear for the next three months that he was extremely unhappy about being evicted without prior consultation.</p>\n<p>He hated the outside world and everything in it. He hated the car, the pram, the bouncer, the cot, the rocker, the bassinette, the sling. He hated being rocked, jiggled, bounced, picked up, put down, held still or walked around. Nor did he seem particularly fond of me. What kind of mother can&#8217;t comfort her own child?</p>\n<p>He didn’t sleep much, but he screamed a lot (thank you silent reflux). This is the kind of kid that crazy is made of. The kind of baby that has his mother in tears of despair and impotence and frustration every single day.</p>\n<p>The kind of baby you never expect to get second time around because this shit is meant to get easier, not harder. The kind of baby that woke every 1 or 2 hours every single night for three months. The kind of baby that didn’t sleep through the night for 11 months, and then started waking up the entire household at 4:30am instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"9002\" data-permalink=\"http://hugzillablog.com/2015/10/26/a-love-letter-to-the-baby-i-thought-i-hated/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png\" data-orig-size=\"849,561\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.23.43 pm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=480\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9002 size-large\" src=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=480&#038;h=317\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.23.43 pm\" srcset=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=480&amp;h=317 480w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=198 300w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png?w=768&amp;h=507 768w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-23-43-pm.png 849w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a></p>\n<p>There were many dark hours in those early days where I swore to myself that I hated him. There were many more again that I regretted having him at all. I say that here openly, not because I am a heartless sociopath but because it is taboo for a mother to admit to having these feelings of ambivalence and regret about her child when the walls are closing in and she is running on empty.</p>\n<p>It needs to be said &#8211; and to be said more often &#8211; because the truth about babies is that they aren’t all rainbows and unicorns and because they don’t shit silver and piss gold, no matter what the &#8220;Perfect Parent Brigade&#8221; would have you believe.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine posted several times on Facebook when she was clearly struggling in those early days as a first time mum. I saw lots of <em>“….but you still LOVE every minute of it”</em> type replies and I wanted to scream at all of them to stop peddling this bullshit myth that women must at all times martyr themselves to their children and still pretend to love every stinking minute of it.</p>\n<p><em>My baby bites down so hard on my nipple that I swear to god it almost shears right off  BUT YOU STILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!</em></p>\n<p><em>My baby screams for 9 hours non-stop between 11am and 8pm BUT YOU STILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!</em></p>\n<p><em>My baby stays up for 11 hours straight during the day like a meth addict on a massive binge and is so wired out of his brain with fatigue that I think I might just go crazy BUT YOU STILL LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT!</em></p>\n<p>Sometimes it borderline sucks. Sometimes it is catastrophically shit. Sometimes you will hate it with every fibre of your being. Sometimes it will have you questioning your sanity. Sometimes you will fantasise about your life prior to having children. And that&#8217;s OK. It doesn’t make you <em>Mommie</em> fucking <em>Dearest</em>. It makes you a human being.</p>\n<p>I love my son with a fierceness I never knew existed but I am the first to admit that I endured that first year more than I enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>Happy first birthday kid.</p>\n<p>We made it through the first 12 months. Now get your shit together.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"9004\" data-permalink=\"http://hugzillablog.com/2015/10/26/a-love-letter-to-the-baby-i-thought-i-hated/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png\" data-orig-size=\"842,554\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.28.57 pm\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=480\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9004 size-large\" src=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=480&#038;h=315\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-10-25 at 9.28.57 pm\" srcset=\"https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=480&amp;h=315 480w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=300&amp;h=197 300w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png?w=768&amp;h=505 768w, https://hugzillablog.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/screen-shot-2015-10-25-at-9-28-57-pm.png 842w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a></p>\n",

It was awarded the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Whitbread_Awards\" target=\"_blank\">Whitbread Book of the Year prize</a>. Dunn and Lesley were living in Hull at the time, where Dunn had originally been a librarian under Philip Larkin. They had no children but clearly had had an intensely loving relationship, he a poet and she a photographer. Writing out of his grief, in <em>Elegies</em> Dunn records not just the awfulness and yet somehow the strange beauty of their days together during her decline &#8211; from the diagnosis onwards &#8211; but also their earlier joyful times together, including living in France for a while. The poems also chart his subsequent return for a period of time to Scotland &#8211; to his birthplace in the west, then to Dundee, where he was Writer in Residence at the University for a year &#8211; and finally his departure back to his empty house in Hull.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_8941\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8941\" data-permalink=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/reading-the-collections-week-35-douglas-dunns-elegies-notebooks/dd-photo-montage_blog/\" data-orig-file=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1223,950\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"DD photo montage_Blog\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=480\" class=\"wp-image-8941 size-large\" src=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=480&#038;h=373\" alt=\"DD photo montage_Blog\" srcset=\"https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=480&amp;h=373 480w, https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=960&amp;h=746 960w, https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=300&amp;h=233 300w, https://standrewsrarebooks.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/dd-photo-montage_blog.jpg?w=768&amp;h=597 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"   /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos from <a href=\"https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27ms38640%2F10%27)\" target=\"_blank\">ms38640/10</a></p></div>\n<p>I can still remember the impact <em>Elegies</em> made upon me when I first read it, working through it in sequence in a way I rarely read any poetry collection, transfixed and left stunned at the end.</p>\n<p>Dunn became a <a href=\"https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/douglas-eaglesham-dunn_3d78c47a-4613-4f60-97bb-bdad308dc8f5.html\" target=\"_blank\">Professor of English in the School of English</a> here in St Andrews in 1991, and around the time of his retirement the Library purchased his <a href=\"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/english/research/creativewriting/dunn/\" target=\"_blank\">archive</a> &#8211; an extensive corpus of notebooks and correspondence. One of the notebooks, generally known as &#8216;the red notebook&#8217;, is particularly well-known – and can be read on our <a href=\"https://arts.st-andrews.ac.uk/digitalhumanities/node/14\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Humanities portal</a>. It contains several of the drafts of the poems that would eventually find publication in <em>Elegies</em> &#8211; and as such it is used by lecturers in the School of English to show the process of artistic composition. For this post, I looked at the red notebook but also &#8211; because it seemed to me that there were a number of poems from <em>Elegies</em> not shown in it &#8211; at the three notebooks from the archive which follow it chronologically.</p>\n<p>Among the drafts of full poems are many fragments &#8211; pairs of lines or brief stanzas &#8211; which belong to poems sometimes eventually published, sometimes discarded. There are also drafts of essays, details of poetry competitions for which Dunn was a judge, story ideas, drafts of works for radio, the surprise of a recipe in one book, snatches of playscripts, and lists of the poems that would eventually be published as <em>Elegies</em>, with the name of the magazines in which they had appeared separately. Some entries are diary accounts (though he kept a separate diary, which is also in the archive), often unbearable as he writes plainly of his heartbreak. To read <em>Elegies</em> is to experience the poet&#8217;s intense personal grief in the form of art. To read the notebooks is to live alongside him, experiencing at times a terrible raw woundedness.</p>\n<p>Many fragments find their way into finally published poems. &#8216;Second Opinion&#8217; deals with the stark experience of diagnosis, and Dunn is unflinching in his description of the impact upon him of attending the hospital appointment with her.

Clearly, for a biographer, there is a wealth of detail available in the extensive archive. But anyone can ask to see these notebooks, and the experience is humbling. It is one thing to have free access to the papers of a deceased poet; quite another to have that access while the poet is still alive and very much present to us here in Scotland, but this seems to me typical of the courage which is at the heart of Dunn&#8217;s work. A quiet, modest man, Dunn is nonetheless a writer whose profound grief, transmuted into one of the most powerful and successful modern collections of poems in the English language, has been lived out fully in the public eye. How do the details of our lives &#8211; the pain, the irritations, the delusions and the joys &#8211; make sense? In the hands of an artist they can be changed into transcendent objects that inspire and help us to see and understand the world, even its terrible grief, more clearly. The papers of Douglas Dunn offer proof of that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\"><strong>John MacColl</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">University Librarian and Director of Library Services</p>\n",

At home. And we were not a family who went out to eat at restaurants except for very special occasions, and then to a Szechuan place about 20 minutes away in Garden City.  The owner spoke Korean. My dad would start conversing with him, and ask for the special menu, meaning the dishes that weren&#8217;t found anywhere on the plastic printed menus with tiny red pepper symbols next to them.  Pretty soon all manner of delicious foods were paraded out and placed on the table, from fried mandu (dumplings deep-fried to a perfect crispy texture, with a slightly chewy inside layer, with seasoned meat inside, just hot enough to make you inhale sharply through pursed lips, but not hot enough to burn your tongue) to seafood dishes brimming with crab, sea cucumber, shrimp, and artistically cut, slightly crisp vegetables swimming in an oyster sauce. Delicately seasoned broths with crackling bits of rice, browned just to the point of crispiness were an entree and not part of the first course. And, at the end of the meal, my dad would not even raise an eyebrow at the bill, always leaving the owner a generous tip, which would then make my mother&#8217;s eyebrows shoot up alarmingly.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t mean to say that we were deprived, as my mother has a knack for tasting a dish, and being able to replicate it, and most of us would prefer to have a home-cooked meal by her over any restaurant meal. But because of this, I grew up fairly unexposed to restaurant Vietnamese food, which is a little different from your home-cooked meals.  The only way to get these was in Windsor, Ontario, which in the pre-9/11 days, was a 20 minute drive across the Ambassador Bridge to University Street.  It felt like a foreign country, the sights and smells just like the Asian grocery store, but multiplied a hundred-fold.</p>\n<p>This was where I first saw the classic dangling barbecued red ducks, held up ignominiously by their clawed feet.  We&#8217;d go into a number of different shops, through some algorithm in my mother&#8217;s head on who had the best prices for whatever she had in her mental list.  I never saw my mother write out a to-do list or shopping list, and constantly wish I had her memory. She mourns the fact that she has trouble remembering things now as she used to know by heart all the phone numbers for all the telephone exchanges for the military base where she met my father. I tell her her memory has subsided to normal human level now.</p>\n<p>One of the visits was always to the herbalist, and the acrid, stinging scent brings back instant memories of the concoction she must have spent precious money on to try to fatten me up. The dark brown, murky liquid with various roots and leaves in it was brewed on the kitchen stove, then ladled into what looked to me like an impossibly large cup. A small piece of hard candy was laid next to it, as incentive to finish the entire thing, preferably without gagging or retching. The house would be permeated with the smell, and my brothers would watch me as I sat at the kitchen table, face resting on fisted hands, sympathetic but staying far enough away that they wouldn&#8217;t be noticed and possibly made to drink it, too. That was in the days when I was in such a hurry to get back to my books that food wasn&#8217;t such a priority to me, and I was, as my mother called it, &#8220;a toothpick&#8221;.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_960\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"960\" data-permalink=\"https://tellitslantmama.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/ode-to-banh-mi/herbaltea/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1600,1347\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Herbaltea\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=300&#038;h=253\" data-large-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=480\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-960\" src=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=300&#038;h=253\" alt=\"It didn't work, unless there is a delayed effect 25 years later.\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=300&amp;h=253 300w, https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=600&amp;h=506 600w, https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/herbaltea.jpg?w=150&amp;h=126 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">It didn&#8217;t work, unless there is a delayed effect occurring 25 years later.</p></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately, I&#8217;ve learned since then how delicious food can be.  Part of that appreciation started with the<em><strong> </strong></em><span lang=\"vi\" xml:lang=\"vi\"><em>Bánh mì</em> sandwich.  The kind my mother always bought was what is known as either <i>bánh mì thịt nguội</i>, or <i>bánh mì đặc biệt.  Bánh mì</i> is a general term for all bread in Vietnamese, however, it is also synonymous with the sandwich, which is made from a French baguette made usually with wheat and rice flour (though I&#8217;m not able to taste much difference between those with rice flour and without). It is one good by-product of the French colonial times in Vietnam. <i> Thịt </i>means meat and <i>nguội </i>means cooled or cold.  This is also sometimes known as<i> <i>bánh mì đặc biệt</i></i> meaning a special sandwich, which seems more than appropriate to me.  It&#8217;s filled with Vietnamese cold cuts which may include what we called Vietnamese bologna growing up or <i><a title=\"Chả lụa\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%E1%BA%A3_l%E1%BB%A5a\">chả lụa</a></i> (pork sausage), <a title=\"Head cheese\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_cheese\">head cheese</a> (more delicious than the name sounds, trust me), and sliced pork roasted with the classic red seasoning, and sometimes liver <i>pâté. </i>Though delicious, the meat wasn&#8217;t the best part of the sandwich, as it could not be complete without pickled carrots and daikon radish, julienned fresh cucumbers and cilantro. A buttery mayonnaise added some moisture and helped to bind all the ingredients together.</span></p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_964\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"964\" data-permalink=\"https://tellitslantmama.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/ode-to-banh-mi/thitngoui/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"320,240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"thitngoui\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" data-large-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg?w=320\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-964\" src=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225\" alt=\"Fixings for \" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/thitngoui.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fixings for <i>bánh mì thịt nguội</i></p></div>\n<p><span lang=\"vi\" xml:lang=\"vi\">Thrown in like little red hand grenades of spiciness were the deadly red Thai chilies, sliced to such minuscule portions that they were nearly impossible to ferret out completely, inevitably leading to abandoning the sandwich briefly for several glasses of water, followed by careful eyeing of the sandwich yet again, before taking the next tentative bites.  Because it is so delicious, and you think you&#8217;ve been meticulous about catching all the peppers, a few more bites will lead to thinking you are safe, and then another ninja chili will cause your tongue or lips to blossom in pain, and the whole process will begin again.

Or so I thought.</p>\n<p>Then when I was in the process of moving to this high desert place we now call home, I made a phone call to the physician assistant program here, in the hopes that they might have an opening so that I could continue to be involved in educating PA students as I had in Detroit.  The PA program director told me that she did not, but would be happy to take my name, and C.V. in the event that an opening came available. As I spelled out my name for her, the tone of her voice changed from polite interest to animated questioning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Are you Vietnamese?&#8221; she asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, well, half anyway,&#8221; I replied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Can you speak Vietnamese?&#8221;, she asked, her voice becoming more excited.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Um, yes?&#8221; But what does that have to do with teaching PA students I wondered to myself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Did you know there is a very large Vietnamese population here? And some of our students are Vietnamese.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I assumed it was mostly Spanish and Native American,&#8221; I responded, wonder dawning in my voice.</p>\n<p>In the end, I got to teach here, and not only that I discovered the proximity of not one, but several Vietnamese sandwich shops, Vietnamese restaurants, and even a Vietnamese church. I had gone from being related to the only Vietnamese people I knew (other than those I met in college), to a city filled with them, completely on accident.</p>\n<p>And so I did the only thing I could do.  I went to every Vietnamese place I could find to try the <i>bánh mì </i>(and the phở, but that&#8217;s another blog post). Purely for research purposes, of course. I discovered <i>bánh mì thịt heo <i>nướng,</i></i> what I now call the gateway <i>bánh mì, </i>filled with seasoned roast pork, a sandwich no one I&#8217;ve ever introduced to has ever disliked. And, like so many other things, I&#8217;ve discovered that there are many right ways to make a <i>bánh mì</i><em>, </em>all of them informed by personal choice, with variations in bread which is normally baked on site, fillings, types of vegetables included, consistency of mayonnaise (which is definitely not Hellman&#8217;s) and chilis used. Here in the Southwest, those red ninja-stealth chilis have been replaced by jalapenos, which when seeded and sliced, often look just like the much more innocuous green pepper.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_962\" style=\"width: 193px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img data-attachment-id=\"962\" data-permalink=\"https://tellitslantmama.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/ode-to-banh-mi/jalapenopic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/jalapenopic.jpg?w=480\" data-orig-size=\"183,276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Jalapenopic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/jalapenopic.jpg?w=480?w=183\" data-large-file=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/jalapenopic.jpg?w=480?w=183\" class=\"size-full wp-image-962\" src=\"https://tellitslantmama.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/jalapenopic.jpg?w=480\" alt=\"Fresh, they could be green peppers in your sandwich.

So still I can barely hear the crickets chirp. The window is open wide to the sultry night and somewhere far down the street a dog barks. It must be midnight. Every now and then, the faintest, coolest breeze kisses my skin. The leaves sigh.</p>\n<p>Softly he rests his hand on my arm.</p>\n<p>“Don’t. Touch. Me.” My lips scarcely move. The words are a flat monotone in the dark.</p>\n<p>His amused chuckle fills the heated space between us, and he rolls over.</p>\n<p>It’s too hot. Too hot to touch. To be touched. Too hot to think, to exhale, to remember if I turned the dishwasher on. Even the whisper-soft breeze has stopped. It’s too hot to sleep and I feverishly wonder what tomorrow will bring. If it ever comes.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>The sun scorches the trail we’re walking on, and a spotted lizard darts under a bush next to me. Its branches are crackly and brittle, and the dry leaves curl themselves like miniature cups, waiting for water. I take just a sip. It’s warm.</p>\n<p>“I want to find the French Trail,” I murmur. I know that is the trail that is shaded and cool. It’s the trail where the trees are the tallest. They stretch and bend their skinny redwood trunks up up up toward the sun and they filter the light in leafy, holy patterns. G-d’s light.</p>\n<p>But I am not usually able to find it. I take a wrong turn, start on the wrong path, or run out of time.</p>\n<p>“Okay, so let’s find it,” he says next to me. He holds out his hand as we start to make our way down through the trees, out of the dusty, beating sun and over the thick roots and fallen logs. Something scuttles but otherwise all is quiet. The sky stretches white-blue above us and the sweat makes a slow trickle down my neck. I grab his hand. Too hot.</p>\n<p>We walk carefully in silence for a while. The roots coil over each other in deceptive lines, and I worry he is going to twist his ankle. He asks if I’m okay.</p>\n<p>“Here it is!” I can’t believe it. French Trail with an arrow that way.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t wanted to go on a hike that morning. The heat is intolerable, insufferable and the sun bites my skin with iron-hot teeth every time I go outside. I am moody and cranky and only looking for ways to escape, not walk towards, any kind of inferno. Out there or inside.</p>\n<p>And there is a grocery list at the bottom of my purse, and two essays waiting to be continued, and it’s an early dismissal day so even less hours to get this sweaty mess together. Who hikes when it’s 95 degrees out… at 9am?</p>\n<p>But it is a rare morning of togetherness. A time that caught us both by surprise, when we could shift schedules and be flexible and walk and talk and breathe in nature and in light.</p>\n<p>The light floats through the trees and we walk, close but not touching. This is where I want to be, I think, in this cool, shaded silence that smells green and full of hope. Hope that the drought will break, that the heat will ease, that this peace and calm will stay with us today and tomorrow and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>And suddenly we are back in the sun, working our way upward to where we started. Because what goes down must always come back up, and it’s hard. The flies buzz around my ears and the dust is in my nose and I stop to gasp mouthfuls of hot, stagnant air every few feet. Slow-going.</p>\n<p>“You are so noisy,” I mutter as he tries his own system of inhale exhale. My disapproval is as thick as the air.</p>\n<p>“Just trying to survive,” he puffs as he strides past me. I knew he would say that. When I come around the next bend he is waiting for me. We are steps away from the car.</p>\n<p>“It was so great until the last part.” I stop right there in the broiling sun. He nods in agreement. And even as the words are out my mouth I know that’s not true. It was great, even the last part. It is great. And it’s not over.</p>\n<p>It’s time to say goodbye. To get on with our days, as usual. To try and stay cool, and remember that in the parched dust of our discomfort and in the breathtaking dappled light of love and ease, we are together.</p>\n<p>“This was a good suggestion,” I say.</p>\n<p>“I’m glad you were available,” he replies.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1136\" data-permalink=\"http://redboots.me/2015/09/10/too-hot-not-to-handle/img_4223/\" data-orig-file=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,640\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 6&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1441792264&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;2.65&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.033333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_4223\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg?w=480\" class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1136\" src=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150\" alt=\"IMG_4223\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://redbootsdotme.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/img_4223.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>This is a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/209952282509046/\" target=\"_blank\">Finish the Sentence Friday</a> post, where writers and bloggers gather together to share their versions of a completed sentence.

In the section of her book that addresses homosexuality she describes it as a<strong> “deadly sexual assault of the evil one in our society”</strong> and proclaims that <strong>“God can indeed deliver you and anxiously awaits your full cooperation”</strong> while claiming that <strong>“every person I know who has been liberated from this lifestyle has described it as obsessive, controlling and increasingly absorbing … in a way only understood in the unseen world, a satanically induced web is associated with this particular yoke.”</strong></p>\n<p>Below is a letter from Meredith Indermaur to Beth Moore. Meredith wrote to Beth hoping her story and personal experience of being the mother of son who is gay would make an impact on Moore and cause her to take the time to re-examine her beliefs and statements regarding lgbt people.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Beth did not respond to Meredith. Instead, someone from Living Proof Ministries responded on behalf of Beth. The response was generic and could have been used as a response to anyone complaining or questioning something Beth taught. There was a reference to the personal story written in at the end of the letter but no compassion expressed for how hurtful or damaging the statements in &#8220;<em>Praying God’s Word&#8221;</em> would be to the loving mother of an lgbt child or to an lgbt person themselves.</p>\n<p>Although Meredith didn’t receive the response she hoped for I am sharing her story here with the hope that it will help someone else break free from the damaging and harmful message about lgbt people that Beth Moore hasn&#8217;t yet recanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Letter to Beth:</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Beth,</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m writing to you on National Coming Out Day. Although I&#8217;m not gay, I have a child who is, and I believe I owe it to him and others like him to tell them the truth in love.</p>\n<p>The thing about that is this: You and I view that truth differently, and acting upon the truth that I&#8217;ve learned has saved his life.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to tell you a story.</p>\n<p>Until 2009, I was a Christian who was also homophobic. One of my &#8220;claims to fame&#8221; was writing a letter to the editor of the Raleigh News and Observer decrying homosexuality, agreeing with the Book of Leviticus that it was THE abomination of abominations. I even received a heartfelt but what I considered misguided letter by a gay man the next town over, telling me that it was my kind of theology that so wounded the LGBT community; while his letter stung and gave me pause, I chalked it up to his being wrong. I&#8217;d been praying for a couple of years at that point for God to break my heart for the things that break His. I had a few ideas of maybe someone whom He could put on my path (like a poor person, for example), but God had bigger things in mind for my heart &#8211; much, much bigger (and closer to home) things. 2009 was the year my then-17 year old son came out to my husband and me after years of battling depression and suicidal thoughts. We&#8217;d had inklings all along, ever since he was about 3 years old, that he was just different. His interests, even then, were dressing up in his sister&#8217;s tutus, twirling around the room like a ballerina, and playing in my Tupperware. He would be neither distracted nor deterred from these things. We tried sports, but he cried on the field. He cried on ALL fields. We gave him Batman pajamas which he never wore. He had no interest in rough-housing or getting dirty. He begged to take dance, but we said no and made him sit through piano lessons. He did enjoy Boy Scouts, however, and he even went on to earn the rank of Eagle. He also had a deep interest in religion and a love for Jesus from a very early age. But when he confirmed to us what I&#8217;d been fearing for 14 years, I could not &#8211; would not &#8211; see this as the &#8220;thing&#8221; for which I&#8217;d prayed. Instead, I saw it as a moral failure, a lie, a rebellion, and an abandonment of who he really was. I wondered where my husband and I had gone wrong as parents. No thanks to James Dobson, we had been led to believe that our parenting was to blame somehow, but we didn&#8217;t fit the mold of those gay-making parents to which Dobson referred. What, then? Had we not prayed enough? Taken our son to church enough? Was the problem that we were in a mainline rather than in a non-denominational church? Should we have forced him to stick with soccer, or t-ball, or maybe thrown him into football? He had accepted Jesus into his heart at a young age: Was he too young? Did it not &#8220;take?&#8221; Was our son&#8217;s homosexuality the result of some sin in my life or the life of my husband? Was it due to his birth order &#8211; the third child born after 2 girls?</p>\n<p>I could go on, but I won&#8217;t bore you with the details of those years of our examining any and every possibility of causation. I think you understand my point that there is nothing, nothing, nothing my husband and I either did or left undone that caused our son to be gay. He was loved, he was tended to, he was taught God&#8217;s Word, he was not abused, etc., etc., etc. For parents of gay children to hear other Christians say that it is their fault their child is gay is THE wound of wounds &#8211; and it&#8217;s the lie of lies. It&#8217;s right up there with the &#8220;choice&#8221; myth. If I thought I had some responsibility in turning a former straight person gay, I would have God-sized power, which neither I nor anyone else has. If I thought I&#8217;d left some &#8220;door&#8221; open in the life of my child which allowed Satan to have easy access, I&#8217;d not want to live another day. When you love, protect, provide for, pray over, pray with, encourage, discipline, and teach a child, you&#8217;ve done absolutely all the &#8220;right&#8221; you can do for that child. What would make someone believe that a parent who does these things could turn their child gay? And if a parent does not do these things, they still cannot turn their child gay; if that were true, there would be a lot more LGBT people in the world than there already are. There are hordes of abused, neglected children in this world &#8211; which is the real shame &#8211; but they are not gay because they are abused and neglected.</p>\n<p>God used my son &#8211; and others like him &#8211; to break my heart so that more of Him could get in. After repeated face-in-the-carpet prayers of pleading, of bargaining, of begging, the Spirit led me to love. Just love. Love in the truth that my son is fearfully and wonderfully made. Love in the truth that he belongs to God. Love in the truth that God loves him just as he is. Love in the truth that his wholeness is born out of his living the truth of who he is: A gay Jesus-follower. Love in the truth that God has a place for him in His Kingdom. Love in the truth that God does not change sexual orientation in 99.9% of lives; if He did, Exodus would not have shut its doors, and Alan Chambers, himself still gay, would not have penned a book about the dangers of reparative therapy.</p>\n<p>There are many who have entered this conversation with love, compassion, and grace: Pastor Stan Mitchell, Pastor Danillo Cortez, Pastor Ken Wilson, Pastor John Pavlovitz are a handful of those who, after careful, meticulous study of God&#8217;s Word, after hours and hours of prayer, and after &#8220;doing life&#8221; alongside LGBT people have changed their positions. They would rather be &#8220;wrong&#8221; about this than be &#8220;wrong&#8221; about love and acceptance. They would rather tell God on the Last Day that they are guilty of loving too much than barring the doors and loving too little. They would rather embrace than enforce. I and over 600 Christian moms who are members of a private Facebook group stand with these courageous pastors. Many of us have read all your books and participated in all your studies. All of us are grieved to know, for example, that the Sodom story is taught in a such way to make it about homosexuality rather than (when viewed in context) taught the truth that it is about same-sex gang rape and arrogance, greed, and inhospitality as outlined in Ezekiel 16:49-50.</p>\n<p>Jesus said, &#8220;You will know them by their fruit.&#8221; When LGBT people know that they are loved and accepted without the pressure to change what, in reality, cannot be changed, they are free to live for Jesus. Every single LGBT Jesus follower I know has an extra &#8220;something&#8221; that the rest of us don&#8217;t have, and the bulk of that is deep empathy for The Other. Imagine trying to live for Christ with the burden of also trying to change something inborn that cannot be changed and something that man, not God, has placed on your back like a two-ton weight. No wonder so many LGBT youth commit suicide. The message the evangelical community has been delivering for years is not God&#8217;s message, nor is it the Gospel &#8211; it&#8217;s legalism. I thank God every day that He, alone, knows all the backstories and, as such, is the only One Who can judge rightly. It&#8217;s difficult enough for us to love God and love others without the added burden of trying to determine who&#8217;s &#8220;in&#8221; and who&#8217;s &#8220;out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Science is on its way to being a friend to the LGBT community. Epigenetics is in its infancy but is already revealing some stunning discoveries about &#8220;switches&#8221; that have the capability to turn genes off and on as they are related to diseases and also to same-sex attraction. I believe that God is the &#8220;Who,&#8221; but science is the &#8220;how.&#8221; Sexuality is complex, and homosexuality is but one variant of a spectrum that no one fully comprehends &#8211; at least not yet.</p>\n<p>As a child, my son had a sweet disposition, a kind heart, a compassionate spirit, a consuming love for Jesus, and a fascination for all things sparkly. The same holds true today. He, and others like him, have been my greatest teachers.</p>\n<p>Please consider that you may be wrong about homosexuality, just as I&#8217;m open to the possibility that I may be wrong. Please hold your views before the God of creation and ask if there is anything else He needs to show you, and I promise to do the same.</p>\n<p>Your sister in Christ,</p>\n<p><strong>Response from Living Proof Ministries:</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;Dear Meredith,</p>\n<p>Your writing is the right thing and I am so thankful. I truly esteem you, respect you, and am grateful for the privilege to share His Word together.</p>\n<p>I am deeply sorry that any portion in the teaching offended you. I realize there are differences in preferences, and in perspective, and I thank you for writing with yours. You have been heard. I pray our love for Christ outshines any other thing.</p>\n<p>Someone will always differ. We hope you understand. Beth wants so much to serve you well and she teaches with fear and trembling before God She&#8217;d be the first one to tell you how fallible she is. This is one reason why she tells her groups continually to stay under the teachings of many teachers and preachers. Only God can be completely taken at His word and His works alone are perfect. Pray for her, as she never expected to have so much responsibility. Her heart is to encourage people to love God through His Word. We hope that goal was accomplished whether or not you were in complete agreement or understanding over every point of doctrine or interpretation.</p>\n<p>On Beth&#8217;s behalf, please accept our sincere apologies and please forgive us for any offense. The last thing we would want to do is to cause you to stumble.</p>\n<p>I pray that we can keep that focus together, yes, even when the surrounding differ.</p>\n<p>You are dearly loved,</p>\n<p>Nancy</p>\n<p>*And then Nancy penned this by hand: &#8220;Your love for your son is evident &#8211; may God bless you and all your family. We care so much.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Meredith is a member of my private Facebook support group for Christian moms of lgbt kids.

      "content": "<p>Every year the poppy parading gets earlier and earlier like Christmas adverts. The poppy police have been out in force since mid October, complaining that there are people on the telly not bearing the obligatory badge of British militarism. If you don&#8217;t wear a poppy you don&#8217;t support the troops, and if you don&#8217;t support the troops then you&#8217;re practically a member of ISIS.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not enough to remember the dead in your own way. It&#8217;s not allowed to light a quiet candle in your heart. It&#8217;s not permitted to make a donation in private to a charity of your choice. You have to make a show of it. You have to make a public display in an establishment approved manner, a way that doesn&#8217;t challenge or question, a way that won&#8217;t rock any boats or change anything that the powerful do. Poppies are the regimentation of remembrance. We remember the dead as soldiers, not as human beings. A unique life reduced to a name, a rank, and a serial number on serried rows of identical graves. And the civilians who die as collateral damage don&#8217;t get remembered at all. The most personal feeling of all, grief, becomes a public parade.</p>\n<p>The poppy does not represent peace, it never did. It was begun by a man who sent thousands to their deaths WW1 in order to gain a few metres of mud for the Empire. It was a way of raising money to pay for the care of those maimed by a state which had no intention of caring for those it had maimed and then cast out, forgotten and broken. The poppy was sold to raise money to pay for the things that the state wouldn&#8217;t pay for &#8211; to pay for a decent life for those who could no longer provide a decent life for themselves or their families. Almost 100 years later the British state still won&#8217;t take full responsibility for the care of those it has brutalised, but it&#8217;s still ready to rush into war. Poppies ought to be a badge of shame for the British state, instead they became a glorification of it.</p>\n<p>The poppy is not a symbol of pacifism, and it&#8217;s certainly not a symbol of opposition to war. Poppies do not say &#8220;never again&#8221;, they say: &#8220;We will remember the next time too.&#8221; Because this is Britain and there will be a next time, and a time after that, and a time after that, wars and destruction stretching out into the future in a never ending cycle of death and desolation. Poppies are the cant that covers the permanence of warfare and Britain&#8217;s love of bombs and bullets. Poppies are the holy relics of the British state&#8217;s cult of military martyrdom. Oppose it and you&#8217;re a blasphemer, a heretic, a witch who deserves to be burned.</p>\n<p>What exactly are the people who ordered the senseless deaths of servicemen and women doing at services of remembrance? Tony Blair wears a poppy religiously, which is like a murderer appearing at a commemoration service for their victim bearing their photograph and a sad face. Why is it that we remember the victims of militarism with military parades? That&#8217;s wrong. Armies should not be allowed anywhere near a commemoration of those who&#8217;ve died in wars.</p>\n<p>A remembrance of the dead is no place for uniforms, for marching, for generals and admirals. When we remember the dead we&#8217;ve loved and lost we should remember individuals, human beings with their unique lives. It&#8217;s their uniqueness that makes them human and it&#8217;s the loss of that unique humanity that makes their deaths a tragedy. The state sponsored services lose that &#8211; deliberately &#8211; the dead become an undifferentiated mass, dehumanised and depersonalised. And that makes it easier for that same state to send new generations off to fight its wars and to die in foreign lands, or to come home maimed and broken where they&#8217;re forced into work assessment interviews and their needs not met. And then we remember them in the same depersonalised way, and the whole cycle of death and pain and loss repeats itself while the British state presides over another pointless war.</p>\n<p>The best way to help those who have suffered and lost because of the military actions of the British state is to campaign to ensure that the state fulfills its obligations to them. We can do more for ex-servicepeople by ending the iniquities of work assessments for the disabled and providing decent mental health services. But the same government that sponsors the parades and the ceremonies is axing the support services that those who&#8217;ve been wounded require.</p>\n<p>The best way to remember those who have died in war is to ensure that there are no more wars. We can honour the memory of those who died in Britain&#8217;s wars by campaigning to ensure that Britain has no more wars. But the British establishment likes its wars. In the 308 years since Scotland became a part of the UK there have been barely 65 years of peace. That&#8217;s what punching above our weight means, it means parades for the dead whose individuality is lost in a military grave. It means that the establishment which bolsters its position with warfare keeps causing more wars. If we want peace it must mean an end to militarism.</p>\n<p>The glorification of the military is no way to remember the dead who died because of the militarisation of society. We dishonour them. We dishonour the dead when children wearing t-shirts bearing the legend Future Soldier parade with oversized poppies. No child should look forward to a future of warfare. The poppy has ceased to become a symbol of care, it&#8217;s a symbol of militarisation. It&#8217;s a symbol of an establishment that refuses to be challenged. It&#8217;s a symbol of a loss of choice and democracy.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t wear a red poppy. That doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t donate to a charity that helps those who have suffered and lost. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t remember the dead or have no understanding of the sacrifices that others made. That doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t grieve for loss and suffering. What it means is that my grief is personal and will not be regimented. What it means is that I strive for peace, not for the glory of an army.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to wear a poppy, wear a white one. Remember the dead with a symbol of peace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2498\" data-permalink=\"https://weegingerdug.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/hedgehog-of-mass-destruction/butrt-cover-front1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1535,2339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BUTRT cover front(1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=197&#038;h=300\" data-large-file=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=480\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2498\" src=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=197&#038;h=300\" alt=\"BUTRT cover front(1)\" width=\"197\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=197&amp;h=300 197w, https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=394&amp;h=600 394w, https://weegingerdug.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/butrt-cover-front1.jpg?w=98&amp;h=150 98w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px\" /></a>BARKING UP THE RIGHT TREE</strong></p>\n<p>My new book is due to be published on 23 November. <em>Barking Up the Right Tree</em> is an anthology of my articles for The National newspaper and is being published by Vagabond Voices press, who also publish Jim Sillars.
